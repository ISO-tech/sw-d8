<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Vladimir Putin--the pop idol</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>WHO'S HITTING it big with teenage girls in Russia these days? N'Sync? The Backstreet Boys? No, it's Russian President Vladimir Putin.</P>
<P>A pop song idolizing Putin recently got airplay on Russia's leading radio stations--even though the band that sings it does not appear to exist, and the record is not on sale in any stores. The song, "Someone Like Putin," by Singing Together, features a female lead singer complaining that her adolescent boyfriend fights, drinks and does drugs. So she leaves him and looks for someone else&#133;someone like Putin.</P>
<P>The chorus runs: "Someone like Putin, to be full of strength/Someone like Putin, who doesn't drink/Someone like Putin, who doesn't offend/Someone like Putin, who won't run away."</P>
<P>The band's name and slushy lyrics suggest that the artists are part of Come Together, a youth organization that idolizes the president and backs family values. Some commentators, though, think that the song is a heavy-handed attempt to create a theme tune for the upcoming presidential election campaign, in early 2004.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>"THIS GRAVE brought to you by&#133;" That could be the new reality at Waverly Cemetery in Sydney, Australia.</P>
<P>Under a new plan, corporations, clubs and individuals may soon be able to "sponsor" the final resting places of famous Australians buried in the cemetery. Sponsors would get a bronze plaque bearing their name fixed to the grave.</P>
<P>Restoration of a gravesite could cost between $5,000 and $15,000, depending on the work required. After that, an annual grave maintenance fee of between $700 and $1,000 would be charged.</P>
<P>A cemetery spokesperson said applications for sponsorship would be carefully assessed to be sure that they were "appropriate." "Cemeteries have limited funding," said one official. "It's one of the only avenues we have left to help maintain these relics."</P>
