<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>THE DIRECTOR of Planned Parenthood in Iowa could go to jail for refusing to turn over the names of women who got pregnancy tests at the agency's clinics.</P>
<P>Jill June faces fines and a six-month jail sentence for not complying with a judge's order to hand over the records of more than 1,000 women who had positive pregnancy tests during a nine-month period beginning in August 2000.</P>
<P>Investigators are demanding the records to help them track down a woman whose newborn was abandoned in May of last year. They say that every woman who took a pregnancy test is a criminal suspect whose privacy should be invaded--whatever the consequences.</P>
<P>Unbelievably, prosecutors claim that "privacy" isn't an issue--on the grounds that clinic staff members aren't health care workers, so their records aren't privileged.</P>
<P>Three area clinics have already turned over their records, but Planned Parenthood is fighting back. "The precedence this situation could set would be devastating," said Planned Parenthood in a statement. "If women's names could be turned over to law enforcement simply for having a pregnancy test in this case, in the future, women may be too frightened to seek the medical care they need and deserve."</P>
