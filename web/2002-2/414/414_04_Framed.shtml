<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Framed for murder</b></font></P>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">July 12, 2002 | Page 4</font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</P>
</B></I><P>My live-in boyfriend, Ahmad Nelson, is being framed for the killing of a police officer.</P>
<P>The "evidence" is all circumstantial. Witnesses claim to have seen Ahmad walk up to an off-duty police officer named Wes Williams and start shooting. Nothing was taken from Mr. Williams, and no one has confirmed what he was doing at 2:45 a.m. in a neighborhood known for drugs and prostitution, nowhere near his home, police jurisdiction or family. </P>
<P>Ahmad was released from jail (on nonviolent charges still pending) that same morning of April 12, no earlier than 1:48 a.m., and was still on his walk home when the shooting occurred. Two weeks later, a SWAT team of police came to our house, destroyed it and took us both in cuffs to the police station. They took me in my pajamas, barefoot. </P>
<P>At 5 a.m. the next morning, I was released, and Ahmad was booked for first-degree murder of a cop. On May 20, the charge was lowered to second-degree murder because the officer was not in uniform, on duty or driving a squad car.</P>
<P>Now Ahmad is in a part of prison he has never seen, scared and nervous, knowing that he is innocent of this crime--yet realizing the truth is hardly what the system is looking for.</P>
<P>Ahmad had been in and out of trouble from a young age but, within the last couple of years, began to turn his life around. The best thing that has ever happened to him, he says, is his two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Amaria. Together we were building a life, hoping to leave New Orleans--where opportunities are few and police are constantly working against a poor, young Black man.</P>
<P>Family, friends and neighbors have been rallying together for Ahmad's freedom. We have to stop this injustice! With only circumstantial evidence, these liars could take away another good man's life!</P>
<P>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</P>
