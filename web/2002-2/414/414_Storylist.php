<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>FRONT AND BACK PAGES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>This whole system is crooked</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="414_01_DenOfThieves.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Den of thieves</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The director of an energy company makes obscene profits by selling stock he knows will tank. On any given day, you could expect to find this story about another CEO exposed for committing fraud. This time, though, the corporate criminal is George W. Bush.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Behind the AIDS nightmare:</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="414_12_AIDS.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Drug bosses profit while millions die</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">HIV infection rates and deaths from AIDS are skyrocketing worldwide. And the blame lies squarely with the U.S. and other governments in the advanced world.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font></p>

<P><A HREF="414_06_War.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>How can we stop wars?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Humankind is naturally aggressive, territorial and warlike. You can find this claim in all sorts of places--in school textbooks and throughout the media. In this special feature, <I>Socialist Worker</I> shows why the claim that humans are naturally warlike lets the real culprits off the hook.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>UPS spares no expense in attacking workers</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="414_05_UPS.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The truth about Brown</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On July 31, the union contract will expire for some 210,000 Teamsters at United Parcel Service (UPS). UPS likes to promote a squeaky-clean image. But the realities of working for Brown are very different. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Does the mainstream media really lean to the left?</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="414_08_MediaBias.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Exposing the media bias hoax</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The idea that the mainstream media is biased to the left has long been a favorite complaint of right-wing blowhards. But now the right is claiming that they have the inside scoop. </P>

<A HREF="414_03_USWarOfTerror.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Bush's war of terror</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A war against terror or a war of terror? That's the question that comes to mind when you hear how the latest victims of the U.S. war on Afghanistan died--dozens, mainly women and children, torn to pieces by U.S. bombs for the "crime" of being at a wedding celebration.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Will Argentina's crisis drag down the whole continent?</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="414_03_SouthAmerica.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Revolt against the free market</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Argentina's wrenching social crisis could spread throughout Latin America, causing trouble for the U.S. in every corner of its "backyard." Plus the U.S. has reason to fear that the pressure of the crisis is leading to growing struggles of workers and the poor.</P>

<A HREF="414_02_Iraq.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Preparing more horrors for Iraq</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After giving the CIA the green light in June to "remove" Saddam Hussein--meaning to assassinate him--the Bush administration has the Pentagon planning more horrors for Iraq, which was reduced by the U.S. military to a "pre-industrial state" during the 1991 Gulf War.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Joblessness jumps again</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="414_02_JoblessnessJumps.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Is the recovery on the ropes?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Will the jobless recovery give way to a new recession? That was the fear of many mainstream economists following reports that unemployment in June rose to 5.9 percent despite six months of economic growth.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Judge's ruling leaves an innocent man on death row</b></font><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It's no secret that the United States is the most powerful and important backer of the state of Israel. The most common explanation is that the "Israel lobby" exercises huge influence over the U.S. government. But this explanation is wrong.</P>
