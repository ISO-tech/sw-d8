<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>GEORGE W. BUSH says that the "war against terrorism" is priority number one. Except when the terrorists are on his side.</P>
<P>The administration has asked Congress to lift restrictions on U.S. funding and training for the Indonesian military. Indonesia's generals have a long and bloody record of repressing political opposition, especially independence movements in various regions of the country. And the U.S. government backed them at each step.</P>
<P>The restrictions that the White House wants lifted were only put in place in 1999, following the scorched-earth campaign in East Timor carried out by the military and its death squads--in retaliation for the overwhelming vote for independence in a United Nations-sponsored referendum.</P>
<P>Indonesia's former dictator Gen. Suharto was toppled by a mass revolt in 1998. But the military has remained a powerful player, including under the presidency of Megawati Sukarnoputri, who U.S. officials claimed would carry out democratic reforms.</P>
<P>The Indonesian generals even have documented links to Islamic fundamentalist groups with ties to similarly hard-line organizations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.</P>
<P>Reopening the U.S. arms pipeline to Indonesia will only lead to more violence and human rights abuses. But that's okay with the Bush gang--as long as they're committed by U.S. "allies."</P>
