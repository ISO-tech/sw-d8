<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By Bill Roberts</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> | August 23, 2002 | Page 4</font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>DAN PETTY, a founding member of the International Socialist Organization who was loved by all who knew him, died on August 8 at age 51.</P>
<P>Although not an active member over the last decade, his politics remained firm, and he never lost the vision of a better society, fit for human beings to live in. Dan's strength was his commitment to the downtrodden--to the oppressed and exploited of this world. </P>
<P>It was natural for Dan to fight for justice denied. Racism never went unchallenged if it came within his orbit. In Cincinnati, Dan once successfully backed down a group of racist bullies in the midst of a huge crowd during the annual Labor Day fireworks display. He didn't calculate the odds. He calculated the injustice and set about to fix it.</P>
<P>Dan joined the International Socialists while a student at Central Washington State University in 1972. He was active in the antiwar movement and had helped organize a campus strike in 1970, when Nixon extended the Vietnam War into Cambodia. </P>
<P>Dan championed children. He once sold his motorcycle to purchase playground equipment for a co-op day-care center. Children in trouble found their way into Dan's heart--and quite often into his family's home for a period.</P>
<P>Dan had a natural gift for talking to ordinary people. His forthright approach and unassuming manner helped bridge any suspicions.</P>
<P>He served as president of his AFSCME local at the University of Cincinnati physical plant in the mid-1980s. In this period of defeats for the labor movement, Dan stood up to every blow that the bosses dealt. Over time, those blows exacted a price. Because the union was unsuccessful at controlling conditions, Dan was forced by an old motorcycle injury to seek less strenuous employment. </P>
<P>In 1989, he moved to his boyhood home of Spokane, Wash., where he took a job as a proofreader in a printing plant. There, with his wife Celia (also a founding ISO member), they raised two marvelous children of their own and helped several other children survive the cruelty and backwardness of this society.</P>
<P>Besides Celia, a union organizer in New York City, Dan is survived by his son Sean, an active member of the ISO in Los Angeles, and daughter Leia, a student at Lewis and Clark University in Portland, Ore.</P>
<P>Dan's contributions to working-class solidarity and socialism can't be found in a book. They can be found in the hearts and memories of those he touched in his too-short life. </P>
<P>He was a socialist worker who lived his ideals and inspired others by his example. That is a legacy that we who knew him are proud to carry forward.</P>
