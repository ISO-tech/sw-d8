<A HREF="418_01_IraqPlans.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Planning another slaughter in Iraq</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">No country since Vietnam has suffered more destruction from U.S. military power than Iraq. The 1991 Gulf War killed an estimated 200,000 people in a period of just six weeks. Then came a decade of economic warfare--in the form of UN sanctions. But still George W. Bush isn't satisfied.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Making workers pay the price</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="418_12_Airlines.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Airlines bosses lower the ax</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Corporate America is cutting more jobs--and airline bosses are leading the way. This month's bankruptcy filing at US Airways--followed by United Airlines' threat to make the same move--signals an all-out assault on union jobs and benefits across the industry.</P>

<P><A HREF="418_06_Iraq.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The terrible toll of a new war on Iraq</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A recipe for more misery where misery is already the order of the day. That's a good way to describe what the Bush administration has in store for Iraq. In this speical feature, <I>Socialist Worker</I> looks at the bloody toll of the U.S. war.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Iraq anti-sanctions activist Bert Sacks speaks out</b></font><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Earlier this year, the U.S. government fined Bert Sacks $10,000 for bringing needed medicine and supplies to Iraq in violation of economic sanctions. Sacks spoke to <I>SW</I> about the toll of sanctions--and how he's responded to the U.S. government's attempt to silence him.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Latin America suffers the consequences of "neoliberalism"</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="418_05_LatinAmerica.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Pushed to the edge by the IMF</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Brazilian economy remains in turmoil even after this month's record $30 billion bailout loan by the International Monetary Fund. The roots of this crisis are U.S.-backed free-market policies that have caused economic crisis to spread from one end of Latin America to the other. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Framed and put to death because of their political beliefs</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="418_08_SaccoAndVanzetti.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Sacco and Vanzetti</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Seventy-five years ago this month, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti--two Italian immigrants--were executed in the state of Massachusetts. But not before the case and the movement that was organized to save them made a huge impact around the world.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush and his administration of corporate executives may be fans of the free market. But when it came to the "free" discussion of the U.S. economy's problems at a forum in Waco, Texas, last week, they left little to chance.</P>

<P><A HREF="418_03_Colombia.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Colombia's killers get green light</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The dirty war in Colombia just got dirtier, with a little help from the U.S. government. Colombia's new president, &Aacute;lvaro Uribe, can now use dozens of attack helicopters and other supplies provided by the U.S. in operations against left-wing rebels fighting a decades-old civil war.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">John Ashcroft could hardly contain himself in June when he crowed to the world that authorities had arrested an al-Qaeda operative who planned to set off a "dirty bomb" in Washington, D.C. But now, law enforcement officials are admitting that they have no evidence of a "dirty bomb" plot.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Earlier this year, when George W. Bush was "getting tough" on crooked CEOs, he named Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson to head up his corporate crime task force. Turns out Thompson is exceptionally "well-qualified" for the position.</P>
