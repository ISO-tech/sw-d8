<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>FRONT AND BACK PAGES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>No more blood for oil profits</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="427_01_NoBloodForOil.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>No war on Iraq</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We say no to Washington's war on Iraq! That's the message that people from across the country will send George W. Bush October 26 at demonstrations in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Congress rejects extension of jobless benefits</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="427_16_JobsNotWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>We need money for jobs, not war</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Wall Street was counting its money last week during one of the biggest stock-market surges in decades. But the mood was very different at the unemployment office on West Lawrence Avenue in Chicago, where laid-off workers were coping with the worst long-term jobless rate in two decades.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL ANTIWAR SUPPLEMENT</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The facts activists need to know</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="427_05_ExposingLies.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Exposing their lies</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. government has been at war with Iraq for more than a decade, and the lies have been piling up ever since. <I>Socialist Worker</I>'s Anthony Arnove exposes 10 years worth of U.S. propaganda about Iraq.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Bush administration cranks up the propaganda machine</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="427_07_Barsamian.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"The clamor of the chorus for war"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">David Barsamian, the director of Alternative Radio, talked to <I>SW</I> about Washington's propaganda campaign for a new war on Iraq--and the corporate media's complicity.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Antiwar movement takes off</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="427_03_BuildingResistance.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Building the resistance</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">More than 100,000 people are expected at antiwar demonstrations in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco on October 26. This will be the largest show of opposition yet to Bush's drive to war against Iraq--but only the latest in a series of protests in city after city.</P>

<P><A HREF="427_03_UN.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Why the UN won't stop a war</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The arrogance of the Bush administration knows no bounds. Even as U.S. diplomats at the United Nations were negotiating a new resolution on Iraq, Secretary of State Colin Powell was issuing an ultimatum.</P>

<P><A HREF="427_09_Pilger.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The Bush gang's war on the world</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Shoot first and ask questions later. That's the basic idea of the so-called Bush Doctrine. <I>Socialist Worker</I> columnist Sharon Smith reviews John Pilger's book <I>The New Rulers of the World</I>--and explains the background to the White Houe's new imperialist strategy.</P>

<P><A HREF="427_09_Israel.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>U.S. watchdog in the Middle East</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Fully one-third of all aid given by the U.S. government to foreign countries goes to Israel--which has just 0.001 percent of the world's population. Why the imbalance? Because Washington regards Israel as its key "strategic asset" in the oil-rich Middle East.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>A Gulf War veteran speaks out</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="427_06_Swofford.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"I was over there to fight for oil"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Anthony Swofford, a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, wrote in a powerful op-ed article for the <I>New York Times</I> that he was sent to the Gulf to fight for oil profits. Here, he explains why he opposes Bush's drive for a new war on Iraq.</P>

<P><A HREF="427_10_Robinson.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"They want a stranglehold over us"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Billy Robinson is the former president of United Auto Workers Local 2036 at the auto parts maker Accuride in Henderson, Ky.--and a veteran of the Vietnam War. Billy sent this statement of solidarity to the New York City Labor Against War conference, held October 19. </P>

<P><A HREF="427_10_WarAtHome.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Ashcroft's war at home</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Attorney General John Ashcroft pulled out all the stops to get to Chicago on October 9--so he could announce at a press conference that the Feds were indicting Enaam Arnaout, director of a Palos Hills, Ill.-based Muslim charity, with charges relating to "terrorism."</P>

<P><A HREF="427_06_Chickenhawks.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>War cry of the chickenhawks</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It turns out that many of the Bush administration's toughest "hawks" are "chickenhawks"--politically connected rich brats who were able to skip out on their own "patriotic duty" during U.S. wars.</P>

<P><A HREF="427_06_SaddamUSAlly.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Washington's old ally</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Saddam Hussein killed his way to the top and used systematic terror to stay there. And he has the U.S. government to thank for it.</P>

<P><A HREF="427_07_HistoryOfLies.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>A history of lies to justify their wars</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Bush administration has taken Winston Churchill's words--"In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies"--to heart. But the U.S. government has a long history of lying to win public approval for its wars.</P>

<P><A HREF="427_08_Debs.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"Wars have always been waged for plunder"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Socialist Party leader Eugene V. Debs gave a powerful speech against the First World War on June 16, 1918, in Canton, Ohio--and spent 10 years in prison for it. Here, we print excerpts from Debs' Canton speech.</P>

<P><A HREF="427_11_SocialistAlternati.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>An alternative to a world of wars</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ultimately, we can't end wars unless we get rid of a society that creates the conditions for war--capitalism. Workers' power holds the key to creating a world free of war and exploitation. </P>
