<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At the end of the 19th century, the robber barons owned the corporations and banks and the politicians and police.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush told reporters that he was "furious" about recent Palestinian attacks in Israel.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The phrase most associated with Karl Marx is, "Workers of the world unite--you have nothing to lose but your chains."
