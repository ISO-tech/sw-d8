<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The Bush gang's sick war on drugs</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>On September 17, more than 1,000 supporters for the medicinal use of cannabis gathered at Santa Cruz city hall as the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) handed out prescription marijuana to patients in defiance of federal agents. Patients with AIDS, cancer and other terminal illnesses came forward. As one told the crowd, "I am not the enemy."</P>
<P>The protest was sparked by a September 5 raid by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) at the WAMM collective. DEA agents swooped down on the co-op, pointing automatic weapons at paralyzed patients, tore up WAMM's garden and carted off the operators in handcuffs. Such terror and heavy-handed tactics were unwarranted in light of the serious illnesses facing the patients. </P>
<P>But even more, Californians overwhelmingly voted in favor of the legalization of medical marijuana in 1996. The attack on WAMM by the DEA shows that Bush and his cronies have no regard for the democratic process. </P>
<P>The hypocrisy is apparent, as Bush claims to support states' rights only when it comes to anti-abortion laws or school vouchers, but conveniently disregards the will of the people when they oppose his and Attorney General John Ashcroft's right-wing agenda. </P>
<P>As Bush escalates his war plans abroad, he is also increasing the war against the sick and ill at home. </P>
<B><P>Martin Smith,</B> Santa Cruz, Calif.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>, </P>
</B><P>A recent article in the <I>New York Times</I> reported that Vice President Dick Cheney claims to have evidence that Iraq is supporting--and training--members of al-Qaeda.</P>
<P>If Cheney really has the evidence that he claims, then why would there be any concern about not getting support for a new war in the United Nations (UN)? Also, why wouldn't that evidence have been presented to the UN? </P>
<P>The truth of the matter is that the evidence doesn't exist. If it did exist, then there would be very little debate over the invasion plans in the UN or in Congress. There would be virtually across-the-table support for a new war.</P>
<P>This seems to be a last attempt at connecting Iraq with the atrocities on September 11. Every other attempt has proven to be in vain, and there is little doubt in my mind that this is just yet another lie in order to justify the coming war.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>, </P>
</B><P>I totally agree with your articles. Bush and his administration are hypocrites. He wants war in order to complete the job that his father started. </P>
<P>He has no economic sense, and when he leaves office in 2004, his credibility will be zero. That is why he is so aggressively pushing to attack Iraq. </P>
<P>Bush and his administration are the warmongers. They are the axis of evil. We must all come together and stop him.</P>
