<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Why we're marching</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="426_01_ProtestWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Stop Bush's war on Iraq</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For George W. Bush and his gang, no lie is too outrageous to tell to gain support for their war on Iraq--and no tragedy is too awful for the White House to exploit as a justification for extending the "war on terror."</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Bush and the bosses target dockworkers</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="426_12_Dockworkers.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>An attack on all workers</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Shipping bosses are aggressively using George W. Bush's intervention in the West Coast dockworkers' contract dispute to gut the union's power.</P>

<P><A HREF="426_06_Oil.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The politics of oil</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While George W. Bush talks about "liberating the Iraqi people" from Saddam Hussein, the real reasons for his new war have a familiar ring. <i>Socialist Worker</i> shows how Washington is motivated by the drive for oil profits.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Stakes are high in West Coast dockworkers' fight</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="426_05_ILWUStakes.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"This is class struggle"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Make no mistake about it," said one official of the West Coast dockworkers' union at a solidarity rally last week, "the bosses and the government want to bust our union." <i>SW</i> looks at the issues behind this battle.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Why the "party of the people" signed a blank check for war</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="426_08_Dems.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Will the Democrats ever fight?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So that was the best the Democrats in Congress could do? After a couple days of debate last week--interspersed with solemn press conferences to talk about their soul searching--half of the Democrats in Congress voted for a resolution that gives Bush a blank check for a new war on Iraq.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Bush administration plans to install a new dictator in Iraq. Only this one will be an American.</P>

<P><A HREF="426_03_Israel.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Israel's scorched-earth war</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Last week, an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile into a crowded residential neighborhood in the Gaza town of Khan Younis, killing 16 Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called the attack a "success"--and vowed that more such operations would follow.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"It's legal, but God, it smells rotten." That was the conclusion reached by Bill Coyle, an accounting expert at Babson College, after looking at the web of insider deals and accounting scams linking George W. Bush and the Harvard Management Co.</P>

<P><A HREF="426_02_USGermWeapons.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>When the U.S. used germ weapons on "its own people"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bush never tires of denouncing Saddam Hussein for using chemical and biological weapons "against his own people." But, according to Pentagon documents, the U.S. military carried out dozens of tests of these weapons on U.S. soldiers between 1962 and 1973.</P>

<P><A HREF="426_02_FDABigot.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The administration's anti-woman nut</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">W. David Hager may soon become the chair of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) panel on women's health policy. Only problem is, Hager doesn't have a very high opinion of women.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of all the arguments against socialism, the most persistent is that a socialist society could never work because human nature is flawed--that people are by nature greedy, selfish and violent.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since the Bush administration announced its new doctrine of "preemption"--invading any country it chooses--they've claimed that they aren't advocating anything new. After all, they say, they're merely following in the footsteps of President Kennedy during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.</P>
