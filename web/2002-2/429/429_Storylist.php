<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="429_01_Washington.shtml">Washington's twisted priorities</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Tax breaks for the rich. A relentless drive to war. And crumbs for the rising numbers of long-term unemployed. Those were Washington's priorities before the November 5 elections. And they'll be the priorities the day after.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Opposition to a war on Iraq is spreading</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="429_12_Opposition.shtml">Stop Bush's war drive!</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Support for a U.S. war against Iraq has continued to drop even as the administration tries to keep up a war frenzy. But none of this matters to the Bush gang.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Two parties of big business</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="429_06_TwoParties.shtml">Washington's rotten system</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The excitement and frenzied speculation among pundits and insiders going into the midterm elections contrasted starkly to the disinterest of most voters. <I>Socialist Worker</I> looks at Election 2002--and what it says about the U.S. political system.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Corporate America cuts jobs to prop up the bottom line</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="429_05_Economy.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Crisis of the "go-nowhere economy"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Whether it's a recession, a recovery or something in between, Corporate America will keep cutting jobs and closing factories in a drive to boost profits.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Why antiwar activists shouldn't claim the American flag</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="429_08_PeacePatriots.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>We aren't the "real patriots"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Among the more than 200,000 people who protested a new U.S. war on Iraq across the country October 26, a common idea put forward was that opponents of war are the "real patriots." But before a single antiwar activist takes up the American flag, they should take a closer look at what it really represents. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Every opinion poll going into the election showed Democrats had the advantage on the issues. Yet the "party of the people" never put forward a real alternative to the Republican program. And as they found out on Election Night, you can't beat something with nothing.</P>

<P><A HREF="429_03_SocialForum.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Saying no to a Europe for bosses</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Tens of thousands of people will come this week from across Europe to attend the European Social Forum in Florence, Italy. "A different Europe is possible--against neo-liberalism, war and racism" is the call for the gathering.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The pictures were gut wrenching--dozens of people risking their lives by running across a Florida freeway and begging motorists to take them to safety. And instead of being welcomed into the "land of the free," these immigrants have been thrown in U.S. immigration detention centers.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Accounting watchdog appoints old crony</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="429_02_Pitt.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Dirty deals at the SEC</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bush sent a goat to guard the lettuce. Last year, he appointed Harvey Pitt--one of the accounting industry's top lawyers--to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Then Enron collapsed, and Pitt was suddenly faced with demands for a housecleaning among his old clients.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"They kept us in cages like animals," Jan Mohammed told reporters as he arrived back home in Afghanistan. He was one of four detainees released last week from the U.S. military's prison camp in Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba--after months of interrogations and brutal conditions.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By the twisted logic of U.S. imperialism, when Washington and its allies use poison gas, they are striking a blow against "terrorism." When its enemies do the same, they are committing crimes against humanity. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A tentative agreement on technology in the West Coast dockworkers' contract struggle appeared to give management the upper hand on that crucial issue.
