<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>FRONT AND BACK PAGES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Bush, Powell, Rumsfeld, Cheney</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="422_01_AxisOfLiars.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Axis of liars</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush stood before the United Nations General Assembly on September 12 as judge, jury and would-be executioner of Iraq. He threatened more war against a country already devastated by 12 years of bombs and sanctions.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Ashcroft and the Feds shred civil liberties</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="422_12_Ashcroft.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>An attack on all our rights</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The assault on civil liberties is ratcheting up as politicians and prosecutors use the "war on terror" to curtail all our rights. </P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Sharon's war crime</b></font><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One of the most horrific war crimes of the 20th century took place 20 years ago this week--the slaughter of defenseless Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Shatila camps in Lebanon during Israel's 1982 invasion.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Don't trust the United Nations to stop a war on Iraq</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="422_08_UN.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>How the UN covers for U.S. wars</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Last week, Bush challenged the UN to "serve the purpose of its founding." And despite the rhetoric about "peace" and the "world community," UN support for a U.S. war on Iraq would in fact do just this--since the UN has many times served as a fig leaf for U.S. military power.</P>

<P><A HREF="422_05_HealthCareCrisis.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Hidden crisis in health care</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Politicians may talk about health care "reform," but none of them dares to take up the hidden crisis in U.S. health care--with a majority of patients paying more money for fewer services at hospitals, while health care workers struggle to provide care at dangerously low staffing levels.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One year after September 11, there is a much larger group of people who don't trust Washington's excuses. The potential for rebuilding an antiwar movement is much greater. It's time to get to work making it happen.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Employers are out to gut the strength of the some the most powerful unions in the U.S.--but labor leaders are surrendering without a fight.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush's "war on terrorism" gets dirtier all the time. Last week, the government of Colombian President Alvaro Uribe--one of Bush's "anti-terror" allies--gave its police and security forces increased powers to detain, arrest and search "suspects" without any evidence or search warrants. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Illinois prisoners' hunger strike protests conditions</b></font><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Within days of last September 11, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz casually announced that the Bush administration would seek to "end states" that harbor terrorists. Although the administration slapped down Wolfowitz for his candor, his plan has become official U.S. policy. </P>
