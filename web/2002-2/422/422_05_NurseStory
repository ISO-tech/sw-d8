It's a very busy unit. The babies in our nurseries are often premature and are too sick to go home, often for several months.</P><P>In the intensive care unit, the babies are very small and often are on ventilators to help them breathe, so nurses are assigned to take care of no more than two babies each shift. In the intermediate nurseries, the babies are less critical, so a nurse takes care of up to four babies each shift.</P><P>Recently, we were told by our assistant head nurse that things would be changing on our unit. Our hospital was taken over by a big not-for-profit health care organization that acts suspiciously like a for-profit corporation--and unfortunately, we don't have a union to represent us. </P><P>We were told that that the hospital needed to cut costs if it was going to stay afloat. Therefore, we were told, management was eliminating one of the rotating positions on our unit--what we call the "backup" nurse.</P><P>Whoever is assigned to be the backup nurse doesn't have patients, but they assist the one nurse assigned to care for all new babies born, they transport babies to procedures, and they relieve nurses in the intermediate nurseries for lunch and breaks. </P><P>Every nurse can tell about a time when they were gowned up in a surgical area for a caesarian delivery and they got a call to assist on another delivery. This happens a lot. With a backup, we can take care of both. </P><P>When I and several other nurses were told about the plan to eliminate the backup, we all expressed our frustration. Who's going to cover deliveries when we get busy? Who's supposed to relieve nurses for breaks? Who's going to watch the intermediate nurseries, filled with three to four sick babies each, when we have to go to the bathroom? </P><P>The answer back was that we'd have to rely on the unit secretary, who has no medical training. It's a serious violation of hospital policy to have nonmedical personnel watch our nurseries. So I pressed. </P><P>I asked what would happen if something went wrong in my room. Could I tell the parents that management said the secretary should watch my room? He said, "Absolutely not. I never said that."</P><P>The discussion got intense, and the assistant head nurse said that there would be a meeting with nursing management where we could express our concerns. "Just offer solutions, don't complain," we were told.</P><P>Four of us did go the meeting. Surprise, surprise--the higher-up acted shocked to hear that the backup position was being eliminated when that would be so dangerous to patient care. But she contradicted herself by saying that she supported the decisions of our immediate supervisors.</P><P>Everyone on the unit felt good that we had stuck up for ourselves, despite the pressure we had been getting. The issue is far from resolved, but it feels as though people were drawing a line in the sand and saying that there are some things that can't be cut back. </P><P>Nurses need to be able to able to do our jobs without putting our patients in danger.</P>
