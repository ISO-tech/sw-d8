<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>INS is stepping up deportation drive</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>The racist Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) is trying to deport Bronx rapper Slick Rick, who's been in detention since June 1. </P>
<P>Readers who follow music might know Rick for his distinctive black eye-patch. He was born in England and moved to the Bronx at the age of 11. In 1990, he was convicted of attempted murder and spent several years in prison. </P>
<P>The INS attempted to deport him first in 1995, but failed. In 1996, Congress passed a law allowing the INS to detain or deport noncitizen felons even after they had served their time. Rick has a wife and child, who are both U.S. citizens.</P>
<P>Slick Rick's fame, connections and fortune will probably spare him from being deported. But if a well-to-do legal immigrant can be detained for months on end by the INS, what does this say to the poor and undocumented? As he put it: "If I wasn't Slick Rick, there would be no sign of any sympathy. I'm not the only bad case. There are a hundred other cases that are even worse than this."</P>
<P>Rick isn't a saint--his albums often include sexist lyrics--but this is a question of human rights. The INS needs to be abolished and people given the same free-flow across the borders as multinational commerce is already afforded.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>A recent letter to the editor (<I>SW,</I> August 30) argued that the murders and murder-suicide by Fort Bragg troops happened because "these are soldiers who were taught to murder, maim and participate in a slaughter in Afghanistan." </P>
<P>"Is it any wonder that sooner or later they bring that violence home?" asked the author. "These murders are a product of the changes that a person undergoes when confronted by the horrors of war."</P>
<P>Readers could hardly be blamed for concluding from this line of argument that soldiers are nothing but a pack of mindless homicidal maniacs. But if that's true, then how can what soldiers did to end the war in Vietnam possibly be explained?</P>
<P>They were also ordered to murder and maim. Many followed those orders--until they rebelled. "By every conceivable indicator, our Army that now remains in Vietnam is in a state approaching collapse, with individual units avoiding or having refused combat, murdering their officers and non-commissioned officers, drug-ridden and dispirited where not near mutinous," wrote Col. Robert Heinl in the <I>Armed Forces Journal</I> in June 1971.</P>
<P>The revolt of the Tsarist troops in 1917 started the Russian Revolution, and the revolt of the American troops in Vietnam signaled the end of the war. </P>
<P>Some on the left, instead of scorning soldiers as disgusting homicidal maniacs, did everything they could to reach out to rank-and-file soldiers with political arguments against the war, and helped soldiers organize to oppose it.  </P>
<P>To understand why it is necessary for us to do the same today, read "The GI's Revolt" in <I>The American War: Vietnam,</I> by Jonathan Neale, available from Haymarket Books.</P>

<p><a name="bans"></a><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>I support bans on smoking at work</b></font></P>
<B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>Sherry Wolf recently wrote a letter about smoking bans and taxes (<I>SW,</I> August 30), in which she said: "Unfortunately, many progressives support the smoking bans and higher taxes."</P>
<P>I agree that sales taxes are regressive and an attack on workers that should be opposed. However, I think <I>SW</I> should support smoking bans in workplaces--airplanes, restaurants, offices, factories, etc.</P>
<P>Environmental tobacco smoke (or "second-hand smoke") is a poison. It is classified as a Class-A carcinogen--as is asbestos--by the federal government. Its presence at work is a danger that people should not have to endure in order to make a living.</P>
<P>Flight attendants' unions have fought for and won smoking bans on both domestic and international flights. Just as <I>SW</I> supports other workplace-safety laws (and opposes the ongoing cutbacks in OSHA inspectors), so too should it support smoking bans.</P>
