<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As the anniversary of the September 11 attacks approaches, members of the Bush administration will participate in somber memorials to the victims. But beneath their words will be a calculated, cynical effort by the Bush gang to build more pressure for the next phase of their "war on terror"--a war on Iraq.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. would rather fill a jail than a school. By the end of last year, one out of every 32 adults in the U.S.--or 6.6 million people--was behind bars, on probation or on parole.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Within hours of the September 11 attacks, the U.S. political establishment was beating the drums for war. But after a year, who has suffered? <I>Socialist Worker </I>looks at the consequences of the U.S. "war on terror"--abroad and at home.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Negotiations to continue after union halts vote on contract</b></font><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Boeing Co., one of the world's most powerful corporations, is out to destroy the power of the union by imposing a contract that would allow even more outsourcing to nonunion contractors. <I>Socialist Worker</I> spoke to two longtime IAM activists at Boeing about their struggle.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A slew of pundits and politicians has raised objections to the Bush gang's plan for a new war on Iraq. But no one in the Washington establishment is willing to answer the fundamental question: What gives the U.S. government the right to declare that it's time for a "regime change" in Iraq? </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="420_03_WorldSummit.shtml">Less than nothing for the poor</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Washington's our-way-or-the-highway attitude was on full display at the Earth Summit in South Africa. First, George W. Bush refuses to attend. Then, administration hacks throw Washington's weight around to make sure nothing gets accomplished.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It was clear that Florida's child-welfare system needed to change when 5-year-old Rilya Wilson went missing from foster care for 15 months before anyone noticed. But it doesn't need the kind of changes that Gov. Jeb Bush has in mind.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Every U.S. military intervention has been accompanied by a web of lies and deception. Thus, George W. Bush claims that the "war on terrorism" will cleanse the world of "evildoers" who "hate freedom." But in reality, the U.S. has very different goals for the "war on terrorism." </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>The Rising</I> is a powerful tribute to the victims of September 11 and their family and friends.
