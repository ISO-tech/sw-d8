<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>GEORGE W. BUSH and his buddies are oozing confidence. They think that if they scare enough people and threaten the rest, they'll get their way.</P>
<P>But last weekend, more than 750 people gathered in Chicago to put forward the vision of a better world--a socialist world. Socialism 2002, a conference co-sponsored by <I>Socialist Worker</I>, featured activists from the front lines of some of today's most important battles--from Ken Riley, the president of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1422 in South Carolina, to Palestinian rights activists Rania Masri and Naseer Aruri.</P>
<P>And socialists and activists from across the globe--from Argentina and Brazil to Greece, Italy and Canada--came to talk about their own fights and show their solidarity.</P>
<P>Just as importantly, those who attended discussed the history of the socialist tradition--and the ideas and theories that have guided our movement. Crowds of people spilled out of meetings on everything from Marxist economics to the politics of religion.</P>
<P>"I came to the conference this weekend because I really want to make a difference in society--if not for me, then for my daughter and her children," said Stephanie Reyes of Washington, D.C. </P>
<P>Greta Holmes, a member of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty in Chicago, agreed. "I've been before, and I just think it's a marvelous educational experience, a mind-expander," she said. "I just like being in all this energy, all this dynamo of humanity that's so committed to changing this system."</P>
