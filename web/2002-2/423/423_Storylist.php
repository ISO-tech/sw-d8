<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Bush administration summed up its foreign policy goals in a terrifying national security document sent to Congress last week. In short, it says that George W. Bush has the right to attack any country he pleases--and he doesn't need a reason.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The economic and political leaders who will gather for the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, D.C., this week will talk about poverty.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It's official.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Israeli forces smashed into Yasser Arafat's compound in Ramallah last weekend, using bulldozers to flatten all but one building in which Arafat was trapped.
