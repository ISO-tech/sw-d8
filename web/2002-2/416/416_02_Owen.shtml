<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>PRISCILLA OWEN is considered a conservative crank even by other conservative cranks.</P>
<P>Alberto Gonzales--who served as a justice with Owen on the Texas Supreme Court and is now the current White House counsel--once criticized Owen for her fanatical opposition to an abortion in 2000. Following her lead "would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism," Gonzales said.</P>
<P>But that hasn't stopped Gonzales and the rest of the Bush gang from going all out to win Senate confirmation of Owen's nomination to be a justice on the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</P>
<P>Not everyone is enthusiastic. "Her nomination really shocked a lot of Texas Supreme Court insiders, because she was not considered the best and the brightest," a former Texas Supreme Court clerk told <I>Salon</I> magazine. </P>
<P>Nan Aron, of the Alliance for Justice, was more direct. "Mention her name and people say, 'Oh, Judge Enron&#130;'" Aron told Britain's <I>Observer</I> newspaper. That's because Owen received more than $8,000 in political contributions from Enron during her campaigns for the Texas Supreme Court. In return, she wrote the opinion in a decision that exempted the energy giant from paying school taxes.</P>
<P>Owen is best known, though, as an especially crazed opponent of abortion. During her career as a judge, she has heard numerous cases regarding the state's parental notification law--and in every case but one, she voted against the women seeking abortions.</P>
<P>Unbelievably, Republicans claim that Democrats are opposing Owen because she's a woman. Democrats are expected to block the nomination. But anti-abortion bigots have more attacks ready--including another bill to ban the late-term procedure misnamed "partial-birth" abortion.</P>
<P>We can't be complacent in the face of these attacks.</P>
