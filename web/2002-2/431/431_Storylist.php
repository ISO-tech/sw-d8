<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>FRONT AND BACK PAGES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Stop Washington's war</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="431_01_StopWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>This is what they want in Iraq</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">United Nations weapons inspectors have been rolling into Iraq. But that hasn't stopped the Bush administration from moving ahead with its war plans.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Bush steps up assault on labor</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="431_12_UnionBusters.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>White House union-busters</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Stripping union rights from tens of thousands of federal workers. Outsourcing 850,000 government jobs. Holding a gun to the heads of West Coast dockworkers. That's the record of George W. Bush's war on organized labor--in just the last five weeks.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Every day is a new struggle to get by</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="431_06_OtherAmerica.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The other America</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The scandals at Enron, WorldCom and other corporate giants have exposed the obscene wealth at the top of U.S. society--and the scams that the superrich used to get that way. But the stories of the people who lost their jobs or slid into poverty in the wake of these scandals didn't usually make the headlines.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Security Council resolution on inspections is designed to fail</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="431_05_UNWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>How the UN set the stage for war</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A rubber stamp for war. That's what the new UN resolution against Iraq amounts to. The resolution is designed to fail--and to give the Bush gang an excuse for its all-out assault.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Has racism always existed? Can it ever be totally abolished?</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="431_08_Racism.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The roots of racism</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For many people coming to radical politics--Blacks and whites alike--hatred of racism and a desire to get rid of it is a huge motivating factor. This is in contrast to some of the common assumptions about where racism comes from.</P>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>WHAT WE THINK</b></font></p>

<P><A HREF="431_03_Movement.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>What's ahead for the antiwar movement?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The most important question for the antiwar movement now is what activists can do locally to broaden the active opposition to the Bush war drive--while bringing political clarity on key political questions through democratic discussion.</P>

<P><A HREF="431_03_NoSacrifice.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>How dare they ask us to sacrifice?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How can jobs be saved in this rotten economy? The employers' answer: Cut workers' wages and benefits to restore profitability. But a look at history shows that giving back hard-won gains to employers simply doesn't save jobs.</P>

<A HREF="431_02_Republicans.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Republicans on the rampage</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The new Congress, where Republicans control both the House and Senate, won't take office until January. But George W. Bush's party is already on a rampage.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Administration hawk lashes out at Europe</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="431_02_Perle.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>And he talks of morality?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Advocate a war that is certain to kill thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians? No problem. But fail to back that war to the hilt? You must lack a "moral compass." This is the world according to Pentagon hack Richard Perle.</P>

<P><A HREF="431_02_VoodooEcon.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Return of voodoo economics</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">His father called it "voodoo economics." But that didn't stop the idiot son from spouting discredited gibberish in defense of last year's tax cut giveaway to the superrich.</P>

<P><A HREF="431_02_GovDocs.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Government documents down the memory hole</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It's the "now you see it, now you don't" method for archiving federal government information.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ariel Sharon is using a Palestinian attack on Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank city of Hebron as an excuse to expand territory held by the right-wing extremists who back him.</P>

<A HREF="431_07_Afghanistan.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>One year after the U.S. "liberated" Afghanistan</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One year ago last week, the U.S. claimed victory in the war in Afghanistan, when its proxy army, the Northern Alliance, marched triumphantly into Kabul, routing the Taliban. But how is "liberated" Afghanistan faring a year later?</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>THE MEANING OF MARXISM</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="431_09_WorkerUnity.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>What leads workers to fight together?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The same conditions that drive workers to compete with one another for jobs and that appear to impose themselves as "natural laws," also propel workers into collective struggle--into organizing and fighting back.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>ISSUES IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="431_11_ILWU.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The ILWU from Bridges to Spinosa</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What would Harry Bridges do? That question has been on the minds of activists among the 10,500 dockworkers in the International Longshore and Warehouse Union ever since Bush invoked the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act against them in October.</P>

<P><A HREF="431_04_System.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Inside the system</b></font></A><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Almost 9,000 workers at 113 Chicago-area Dominick's grocery stores--owned by Safeway, Inc.--were working without a contract as <I>Socialist Worker</I> went to press.</P>

<A HREF="431_04_Dems.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The confidence to fight back</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I think it is right to expose the Democrats for their real record and to say that the only way we will win on the issues we care about is through our own struggle. At the same time, I think it is shortsighted to say that it doesn't matter what liberals say on key issues like the war.</P>

<P><A HREF="431_04_Flag.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Should antiwar activists reclaim the flag?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I must disagree with Elizabeth Schulte's position that antiwar demonstrators should repudiate the American flag (<I>SW,</I> November 8).</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I agree totally with your article on Marriott workers (<I>SW,</I> August 30), as I am also a dislocated Marriott employee from one of the distribution centers that they have just closed.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eminem is well known and widely despised for lyrics that routinely joke about rape and violence against women and denigrate gay people. But the new movie <I>8 Mile,</I> which stars Eminem and is loosely based on his life, promotes a quite a different image.</P>
