<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Protesters tell Bush:</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="428_01_NoWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>We don't want war on Iraq</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">People across the U.S. joined antiwar activists around the world last weekend in resounding opposition to Bush's war drive against Iraq--with more than 200,000 rallying in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and other cities on October 26.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Port bosses out to break ILWU</b></font><BR>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Speaking out on October 26</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="428_06_Protest.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"It was time to add our voice"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The demonstrations in Washington and San Francisco on October 26 were some of the largest since Vietnam. Here, <i>Socialist Worker </i>talks to the people who participated in this milestone for the antiwar movement.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B>An issue for the movement</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="428_06_Inspectors.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Should we back UN inspectors?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">People who oppose the Bush war drive are rightly fed up with the White House's snubbing of the rest of the world. But some believe that activists need to support a call for UN weapons inspections in Iraq as an alternative to war. Are they right?</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>How the movement against the Vietnam War took shape</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="428_08_Vietnam.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>A struggle that stopped a war</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">More than 25 years after the end of the Vietnam War, America's rulers are still dealing with the effects of the worst defeat ever suffered by U.S. imperialism.</P>

<A HREF="428_03_Dems.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Why won't they stand up to Bush?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A deteriorating economy. A war drive that most people have grave doubts about. A corporate crime spree. The Republicans ought to be worried about losing the upcoming midterm elections in a landslide--but it's the Democrats who are worried.</P>

<P><A HREF="428_03_Wellstone.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>An honest look at Wellstone's legacy</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of course, no one in the Washington establishment was going to speak ill of the dead. But you couldn't help but notice last week that people who despised Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.)--or at least his liberal principles--suddenly had nothing but good to say about him.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As soon as police announced the name of the suspected Washington, D.C., sniper, the media circus began. Pundits speculated that John Allen Muhammad must have a connection to terrorism--simply because he took a Muslim name in 2000.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>For-profit school scheme</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="428_02_Edison.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Using students as free labor</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Schools should be run like businesses--and kids should be sweatshop workers. At least, that seems to be the theory of Edison Schools, Inc., the for-profit education company that runs dozens of schools in several cities across the country.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the wake of former president Jimmy Carter's selection as Nobel Peace Prize winner, some seem ready to nominate him for sainthood. But the "peacenik" Carter was the president who brought back the military draft in 1979--and started the New Cold War.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The revolutions in Eastern Europe and the collapse of the ex-USSR have been cited many times as evidence of the "death of socialism." But the question depends, above all, on whether these societies should be called socialist. </P>
