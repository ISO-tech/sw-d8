<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Bush wants more tax cuts for the rich</font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Corporate America's front man</b></font></P>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">January 11, 2002 | Page 1</font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>UNEMPLOYMENT IS on the rise and is expected to climb even higher. And George W. Bush's solution? An "economic security" plan.</P>
<P>By packaging his economic proposals as emergency wartime measures, Bush hopes that millions of people worried about keeping their jobs--or finding new ones--will go along. But the only people who would benefit under Bush's plan are plenty secure already.</P>
<P>Two-thirds of the tax cuts in Bush's "economic security" package would go to corporate giants like IBM, General Motors and General Electric. And three-quarters of the new breaks on income taxes would go to the richest one-tenth of individual taxpayers.</P>
<P>Each of the richest 1 percent of taxpayers would get an average tax cut in 2002 of $27,000. This bonus for the rich could go a long way toward supporting one of the hundreds of thousands of workers already left jobless in the last few months alone.</P>
<P>But Bush says that there just isn't enough money in the federal budget for that. Especially since Bush gave away $1.35 trillion in tax cuts last year--$700 billion of which went to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.</P>
<P>Asked last week if he would consider reversing these tax breaks, Dubya snarled, "Not over my dead body."</P>
<P>Even Democrats--who rolled over on the earlier tax cut plan and fell in line behind Bush's "war against terrorism"--had to say something. "They have one unchanging, unyielding solution that they offer for every problem: tax cuts that go disproportionately to the most affluent," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said last week.</P>
<P>True enough. But where was Daschle's indignation when aircraft giant Boeing's buddies in Congress--Republicans and Democrats alike--slipped in a provision in the Pentagon budget bill last month to require the Air Force to lease 100 Boeing 767s for the next 10 years? The deal will net Boeing tens of billions of dollars. But lawmakers wouldn't even think to require Boeing to reverse its plans to lay off 25,000 workers in the next six months.</P>
<P>Likewise, Democrats did nothing to ensure that the 100,000 workers laid off by the airlines would get emergency compensation in Congress' $15 billion bailout for the industry last year.</P>
<P>Bush thinks he can get away with anything because the mainstream media has anointed him a "war leader." But he's still the same dimwit who only succeeded in business and politics with the help of Daddy's rich friends--and who had to be appointed president by a 5-4 vote of the Supreme Court.</P>
<P>Whether he's giving the Pentagon billions to rain death on innocent Afgans in the name of "justice" or rewarding the rich in the name of "security," Bush is simply a front man for the world's wealthiest and most powerful people.</P>
<P>It's time to expose him for what he is--and build an opposition that can stop him.</P>
