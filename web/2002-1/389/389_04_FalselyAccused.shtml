<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</P>
</B></I><P>I watched the news last night and saw a story that really disgusted me. It happened at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, where a former Chicago Board of Education member named Anna Mustafa was preparing to board a plane to Tel Aviv to attend her father's funeral.</P>
<P>When asked if she wanted a Halal meal, Mustafa politely accepted. Suddenly, for no reason, airport police pulled her aside, started questioning her and searched her belongings. She was later accused of being a terrorist, and authorities said that she claimed to have a bomb.</P>
<P>Police arrested her. She was charged with three counts of felony disorderly conduct, and her bail was set at $50,000. After being brutally harassed by the police, she called them racist pigs.</P>
<P>The authorities are now refusing to present the tape that was recorded by the security camera, even though this will prove her innocence.</P>
<P>I am sick and tired of hearing these stories of these racist police who harass innocent people just because of their race or religion.</P>
<P>I am writing to you, because I think that all socialists, as well as other Americans, should support Anna Mustafa, as she is being charged with a crime she did not commit.</P>
