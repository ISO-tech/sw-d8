<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>CHICAGO--In a cold rain, about 50 members of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1702 and their supporters picketed and rallied in front of the Cook-DuPage Transportation (CDT) offices December 14.</P>
<P>Four hundred CDT drivers, mechanics, dispatchers and office workers provide paratransit services for thousands of Chicago residents with disabilities who can't ride the Chicago Transit Authority.</P>
<P>After months of negotiations, union members were fed up with the unwillingness of CDT's owner to negotiate, and voted to authorize a strike in December.</P>
<P>Local 1702 President Erwin Dabney noted CDT had tried to divide workers by offering advances to drivers who didn't join the union and threatening to permanently replace strikers before a strike vote was even called.</P>
<P>The union is calling for a $1.11 raise over 3 years, more union security and respect on the job. Workers are angry that CDT was offering a $.30 raise in the first year, when their uniforms cost $100 a year.</P>
<P>Drivers have to work eight hours before they get a 20-minute break, and health care costs are becoming prohibitive--$40 per pay period for single members and $200 for some members with families.</P>
<P>Workers expressed outrage at the filthy conditions at the garage where they must contend with rats and unsanitary bathrooms. "Our employer gives us no respect," Minnie Williams, a paratransit operator for 12 years, told <I>Socialist Worker</I>. "I haven't had an accident in eight years, and yet we're screamed at. We need better wages and better conditions."</P>
<P>Members of Bricklayers Local 21, Service Employees International Union Local 1 and train and bus drivers' unions from around the city came to the ATU picket to show their support for the paratransit workers.</P>
<P>Dabney said that some of CDT's clients had also planned on attending the rally, but due to the poor weather, many couldn't get there.</P>

<p><a name="Harvard"></a><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Harvard University janitors</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By Mitch Lewis and Larry Lewis</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>CAMBRIDGE--Hundreds of students joined more than 100 mostly immigrant workers at a rally called by Service Employees International Union Local 254. The rally called for a living wage for janitors at Harvard University.</P>
<P>"In seven years, I haven't got a raise," Harvard janitor Blanca Hurtado told <I>Socialist Worker</I>. "I have three kids, and it's not enough to support us all."</P>
<P>Addressing the crowd in both English and Spanish, State Rep. Jarrett Barrios of Cambridge stressed that the living wage campaign is about "basics--rent, health care, child care and cost of living." He pointed out that janitors' wages have dropped 30 percent since 1992. He also cited the Boston-area universities' policy of employing part-time janitors in order to avoid benefits payments and force workers into longer hours.</P>
<P>The rally, though large and enthusiastic, was only a beginning. With wage negotiations coming in January, we need to keep mass pressure on Harvard in the coming months.</P>
<P>Justice for janitors!</P>

<p><a name="Cincinnati"></a><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>University of Cincinnati professors</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By Eric Kerl</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>CINCINNATI--Professors at the University of Cincinnati (UC) have been working without a contract since August 31. After a long stalemate, administrators finally agreed to resume negotiations with the UC chapter of the American Association of University Professors.</P>
<P>The university wants faculty to accept a contract that includes cutbacks in health care benefits totaling $2 million. Salaries are also a big issue, with professors demanding a 20 percent increase over three years.</P>
<P>Other issues include control over what goes into personnel files, governance of the university, domestic partner benefits and bias in the pay of female faculty.</P>
<P>The main sticking point is that the UC administration says it can't afford to give the professors more than an 8 percent raise. But the main campus has seen more than $1 billion in new construction during the past 10 years. And the university is planning construction of a brand new mansion near the school.</P>
<P>UC can afford a raise--but they won't give it without a fight.</P>
