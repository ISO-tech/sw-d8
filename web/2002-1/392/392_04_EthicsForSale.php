<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>HOW ARE former Enron employees making up for the money they lost when the company went belly-up? A few have taken to auctioning off merchandise from Enron's marketing department--including mugs, pens, golf balls, paperweights and office manuals--on Internet sites like E-Bay.</P>
<P>Items that are "sure to become collectibles" include Enron mugs emblazoned with the corporate logo and the phrase "Ask Why," and copies of Enron's "The Basics of Risk Management."</P>
<P>But perhaps the best seller is Enron's "Code of Ethics" manual, which in some cases has gone for more than $200. One copy was advertised as "never read."</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>MOST PEOPLE figure the recent <I>Lord of the Rings</I> movie is just blockbuster entertainment. But Italy's far-right National Alliance party sees it as a recruitment opportunity, inviting young people to "enter the fellowship" in their new ads.</P>
<P>"We want to use the event as an incredible volcano to help people understand our view of the world," said Basilio Catanoso, head of the youth wing of the National Alliance. </P>
<P>The National Alliance believes that <I>Lord of the Rings</I> embodies fascist ideals of physical strength and racial purity. In the 1970s, neo-fascist summer training camps nicknamed "Hobbit Camps" were run by the National Alliance's predecessor.</P>
