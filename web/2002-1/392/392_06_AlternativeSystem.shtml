<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>TENS OF thousands of Argentinians took to the streets at the end of last week in the first major demonstrations since mass protests toppled two governments in December.</P>
<P>The nationwide unrest showed the continued anger of Argentine workers and the poor at harsh free-market policies carried out by two presidents who were forced out of office--and still defended by a third, Eduardo Duhalde.</P>
<P>Every major city saw pot-banging protesters come together for huge rallies. In the capital of Buenos Aires, riot cops attacked a peaceful demonstration, firing volleys of rubber bullets and clashing with demonstrators for hours. The protests show that the spirit of December's Argentinazo is alive and well.</P>
<P>During the early 1990s, Argentina was the poster child for the free-market economic policies promoted by the U.S. government and its servants at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Those very policies--of free trade, privatization, deregulation and austerity--are exactly what drove Argentina into a terrible economic crisis.</P>
<P>But what Washington fears more than the exposure of its economic agenda is the example set by ordinary Argentinians in December. Fed up with a government whose only response to recession was more cuts, masses of people rose up and said "no"--with mass demonstrations across the country that culminated in more than 1 million on the streets of Buenos Aires, a city of 2.7 million.</P>
<P>President Fernando de la R&uacute;a tried to organize a crackdown, but repression couldn't stop the protests--and his government was forced out on December 20, to be followed by a second one a week later.</P>
<P>This set a tremendous example for workers around the world. But it's obvious that the Duhalde government--though it claims to stand for change--is determined to solve Argentina's crisis on the backs of workers.</P>
<P>There is an alternative. The demonstrations in December were the result of years of organizing, led most of all by the unemployed, who developed a tactic of blockading highways to force emergency food aid and job programs from the authorities. These <I>piqueteros</I> have begun to come together in national networks of local organizations--which have the power to take into their own hands the distribution of food and other services.</P>
<P>And Argentine workers, whose general strikes have shut down the country seven times in two years, can go beyond their conservative union leaders and occupy their factories and offices.</P>
<P>The fight in Argentina is showing the alternative to a world of misery and suffering--the struggle to transform the system into one organized around meeting the needs of all, not the demands of the bankers and the multinational corporations.</P>
