<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>EVEN LITTLE fuzzy animals can be the targets of terrorists.</P>
<P>A team of state police, bomb-sniffing dogs and National Guard troops are going to the annual Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney, Pa., to guard "Punxsutawney Phil," the furry rodent who makes his annual weather prediction.</P>
<P>"We just never know what may pop up in these times, so we are getting prepared," said police spokesperson Jamie Levier. "There was only one year we did not have the event," said Bill Cooper, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, "and that was in 1942, because we did not want to give our World War II enemies any favorable weather forecasts."</P>
<P>"Everything has changed in America, but Groundhog Day is one way of showing the world we are getting back to normal," he added. "Normal," apparently, involves bomb-sniffing dogs and National Guard troops armed with guns deployed in Punxsutawney.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>What upset Giorgio Armani?</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>POOR GIORGIO Armani. The Italian fashion designer announced last week that he's "fed up" with luxury. "Luxury disgusts me," he told reporters after showing his latest men's fashion collection.</P>
<P>The collection is inspired by the "working-class" look of miners and soldiers. "I want to pay homage to the workers, to the dignity of the workers with their simplicity and straightforwardness," Armani told reporters backstage as he showed off outfits with flat caps, military boots and donkey jackets.</P>
<P>He pointed out that a pair of jeans from his discount label sells for the "bargain" price of just $88. Of course, several of the suits from his "worker-inspired" line of clothing cost more than $4,000.</P>
