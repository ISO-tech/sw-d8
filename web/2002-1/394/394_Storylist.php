<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As part of opposition to the World Economic Forum, the AFL-CIO hosted an excellent roundtable discussion featuring workers from Mexico, China, Guatemala and the U.S. But missing from the audience was one key element--rank-and-file workers.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The chant raised at the World Economic Forum protests, "We are all Argentina, they are all Enron," could not be more apt, as a whole line of companies are now stepping forward to say that they, too, lied about profits, hid exorbitant payouts to executives and otherwise cooked their books.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The International Olympic Committee allowed the American team to carry a tattered flag recovered from the rubble of the World Trade Center.
