<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</P>
</B></I><P>My name is Sheila Rogers, and I am the youngest sister of Antonino "Nino" Lyons. I am writing on behalf of my brother, who has been thrown in jail unjustly. He was set up by the local police and federal government.</P>
<P>We want to get this case out nationwide so that we can change the criminal justice system and let them know that they can't keep taking our Black men and throwing them in jail.</P>
<P>Nino was a very strong activist for the Black community in his hometown, and this is one of the reasons he has been targeted.</P>
<P>We appreciate your time and support. Please call with any questions. I have packets of info to send out that contain signed letters from prisoners who were approached by government agents and offered sentence reductions if they would lie about Nino. We have tons of information that prove his innocence.</P>
<B><P>Sheila Rogers,</B> Cocoa, Fla.</P>
<I><P>For more information on Nino's case or to support him, visit www.freenino.org or call 1-800-620-6466.</P>
