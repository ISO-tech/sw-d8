<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In states across the country, politicians are being forced to admit what opponents of capital punishment have long known: The death penalty system is racist, arbitrary and punishes the poor.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Right wing on the offensive</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="407_12_IsraelTightensGrip.shtml">Israel tightens its grip</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">With Israeli tanks ringing Gaza and prepared to launch an attack on a moment's notice, the central committee of the party that leads the Israeli government passed a resolution that explicitly repudiates the idea of a Palestinian state.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Israel's long and bloody record of war crimes</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="407_06_IsraelsTerror.shtml">The master of terrorism</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What Israel has carried out in its war against Palestinians invites comparison to some of the worst atrocities of the 20th century--a comparison that at least some Israelis are making themselves.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Tariq Ali on pro-Palestinian protests</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="407_06_TariqAli.shtml">"The mood is changing"</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Left-wing author and activist Tariq Ali was in Washington, D.C., for the April 20 protests against Bush's "war on terrorism" and in support of Palestinian rights.

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Confronting the menace of France's Nazi National Front</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="407_08_StoppingLePen.shtml">How can Le Pen be stopped?</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Often, the mainstream media accept the respectable front that Nazis like Jean-Marie Le Pen put on for voters. But no one should be fooled by sheep's clothing--or underestimate the threat that the Nazis represent, not just to immigrants, who are the main targets of their scapegoating, but to all working people.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Should the poison come with a sugar coating or not? That just about sums up the debate on "fast track" trade legislation that was underway in the Senate as <I>Socialist Worker</I> went to press.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="407_03_CAEnergyRipOff.shtml">California power rip-off exposed</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"I don't think there's any doubt that somebody ought to go to jail." That was the reaction of mild-mannered Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) to the latest revelations in the Enron scandal, which expose its role in last year's California energy crisis.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some environmentalists argue that environmental catastrophes are caused by too much industrial development.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>Ally McBeal</I> wasn't single-handedly responsible for the right-wing project of attacking anything that could be smeared as "politically correct." But the Fox TV show was a sickening reflection of the anti-left crusade.</P>
