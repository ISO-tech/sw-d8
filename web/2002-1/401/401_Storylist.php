<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>FRONT AND BACK PAGES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>"No one is safe from this terror"</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_01_StopIsraelsWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Stop Israel's war on the Palestinians</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has declared an all-out war on Palestinians. And his first target was Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Jobs and benefits slashed while the CEOs cash in</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_12_CEOsCashIn.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"Where am I going to work?"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 20,000 workers who got pink slips from United Airlines last fall are scrambling to make ends meet. But one person who lost his job at United doesn't have to worry. He's James Goodwin, the former CEO who was forced to resign in disgrace--but still got a $5.7 million severance package. </P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>ISRAEL'S REIGN OF TERROR</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>A call to action from besieged Ramallah:</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_06_TouficHaddad.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"Raise your voices right now"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Toufic Haddad is a Palestinian living in Ramallah and co-editor of the left-wing journal <I>Between the Lines</I>. He spoke with <I>Socialist Worker</I> as Israeli soldiers besieged Yasser Arafat's compound not far from his home.</P>

<P><A HREF="401_06_IsraelsCruelReign.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Israel's cruel reign of terror</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. mantra that Yasser Arafat "must make a 100 percent effort to fight terrorism" is a way of avoiding the main issue and the true source of violence--Israel's daily humiliation and intimidation of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living under its military occupation.</P>

<P><A HREF="401_06_SuicideBombings.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Suicide attacks "borne of despair"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Israeli government claims that Palestinian suicide bombings are proof of the fanaticism they must defend against. But in reality, these Palestinian attacks are a product of hopelessness and despair--in the face of Israel's military offensive to drown the Palestinian resistance in blood.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>A look inside Illinois' broken death penalty system</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_05_FaceOfDeathRow.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The real face of death row</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Illinois Gov. George Ryan--who two years ago bowed to growing pressure and called a halt on all executions--has said that he will review the cases of all 163 Illinois death row prisoners during his final months in office. What will he learn?</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The revolutionary legacy that the media covers up</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_08_MalcolmX.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The real Malcolm X</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The recent discovery of letters, diaries and notebooks belonging to Malcolm X has stirred new interest in the man and his politics. But establishment voices that treat Malcolm X as a saint today seek to bury his real legacy of revolutionary internationalism and anti-imperialism.</P>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>WHAT WE THINK</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>U.S. bears responsibility for Israel's savage crackdown</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_03_IsraelUSMonster.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The monster that Washington created</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When reporters asked George W. Bush about the solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict on Monday, he sputtered: "There needs to be a focused coalition effort in the region against peace--I mean, against terror, for peace." He was more truthful the first time.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Supreme Court rules against rights of illegal immigrants</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_03_AntiImmigrantCourt.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>An attack on all workers</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Illegal immigrants don't count as human beings. That's the message that the U.S. Supreme Court sent last week when it ruled in a 5-4 vote that illegal immigrants aren't entitled to legal protection when they are wrongly fired from their jobs.</P>

<P><A HREF="401_03_SWTurns25.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><I>SW</I> turns 25</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>Socialist Worker</I> turns 25 years old this month. That's a quarter century of reporting on struggles throughout U.S. society--the stories of working people that don't make it into the mainstream media.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Residents of the Bay View Hunters Point neighborhood in San Francisco are coming together to say no to police brutality.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Plea from a prisoner held at Guant&aacute;namo Bay:</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_02_CampXRay.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"Can you tell the world about us?"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When journalists toured Camp X-Ray, the U.S. prison camp in Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba, in March, one prisoner tried desperately to attract their attention. "We've been on a hunger strike for 14 days, and nobody cares," he called out. "Can you tell the world about us?"</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>New study exposes racism</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_02_RacistHealthCare.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The back of the health care bus</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"The medical world just reflects the real world." That's how one African American patient summed up the reality of the health care system--a reality reflected in the findings of a report released last month that found that minorities in the U.S. consistently receive lower quality health care than whites.</P>

<P><A HREF="401_02_CourtOKsEvictions.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Justices uphold war on drugs in public housing</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously last week that public housing officials can evict tenants for drug use by family members--whether or not the tenants know about it, and even if it occurs off public housing property.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON?</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_07_Reparations.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Confronting the crime of slavery in the U.S.</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 1865, the U.S. government promised every freed slave 40 acres of tillable land, known as the "40 Acres and a Mule Proclamation." That was the last time the U.S. government gave any thought to compensating African Americans for 300 years of slavery. The reparations movement is now forcing the political establishment to reconsider.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>THE MEANING OF MARXISM</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_09_LiesAboutLenin.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Why do they tell lies about Lenin?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Russian revolutionary Lenin is perhaps the most misunderstood, maligned and lied-about figure in history. If you learn about him at all, you're likely to hear that Lenin was a violent conspirator and a fanatical dictator.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>INSIDE THE SYSTEM</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="401_04_BirdbrainedLogic.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Birdbrained logic</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When environmental groups filed a lawsuit claiming that the Navy's bombing and shelling exercises on the tiny Pacific island of Farallon de Medinilla was killing the native bird population, Navy officials insisted that dropping bombs on the island is actually good--for both birds and bird-watchers.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Thousands of people across the country took to the streets March 30 to commemorate Palestinian Land Day--the day 26 years ago that Israeli soldiers killed six Palestinians protesting the confiscation of their land. But Israel's stepped-up war in Ramallah and elsewhere gave the events added urgency.</P>

<P><A HREF="401_10_Rabih%20Haddad.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Free Rabih Haddad</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Justice Department has provided no credible evidence that either Rabih Haddad or the Global Relief Foundation are connected to "terrorists." But that isn't stopping them from trying.</P>
