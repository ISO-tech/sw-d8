<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">People around the world were outraged by the hellish pictures of the destruction in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. But not in Washington, D.C.--where politicians from across the spectrum pledged their support to Israel during Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's visit this week.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One of the worst developments in the post-September 11 battle of ideas is the newfound respectability of colonialism.
