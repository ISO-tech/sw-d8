<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>Bridget Broderick's article about Cuba (<I>SW,</I> May 24) comes close to supporting Jimmy Carter's recent sermonizing about democracy and human rights in that country. </P>
<P>Broderick is right to debunk the myth of "socialism" or a "workers' state" in a nation where even genuine unions are strictly banned. But by failing to spell out the nature of Cuba's revolution, she leaves out what should be the key to our attitude towards Cuba.</P>
<P>Since the Cuban Revolution, Cuba has been the only country in the Western hemisphere capable of consistently defying the U.S. In other words, it has won national liberation--however fragile and contradictory. </P>
<P>As opponents of U.S. imperialism, our tasks are made easier by the existence of this outpost of independence. As advocates of working-class internationalism, we must argue to U.S. workers that they should support national liberation struggles. </P>
<P>Of course, we also support workers' struggles against their exploiters everywhere, including Cuba. But Cuban workers will find those struggles easier if we oppose and weaken U.S. imperial designs on Cuba.</P>
<P>It needs to be pointed out that liberals like Jimmy Carter--while they may appear more reasonable--are no less committed to restoring U.S. dominance in Cuba than right-wingers like Bush. Carter's comments provide a liberal cover to the more obviously hypocritical calls for Cuban "democracy" by the right wing.</P>
