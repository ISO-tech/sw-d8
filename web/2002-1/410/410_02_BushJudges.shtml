<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Bush nominee approved as federal judge</font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Creeps on the bench</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By Elizabeth Schulte</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> | June 7, 2002 | Page 2</font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>U.S. SENATORS showed just what an old boys' club they are when the Judiciary Committee approved right-wing sleaze D. Brooks Smith as a federal circuit court judge. Democrats provided the margin of victory for George W. Bush's nominee to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Smith is currently a federal district court judge in Western Pennsylvania. Appointed to that seat by Ronald Reagan, he's a longtime member of the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club, a club that bars women from the facilities.</P>
<P>In 1998, Smith was confronted about belonging to the club--and promised that if he was unable to get the bylaws changed, he'd quit. Instead, Smith kept his membership for more than a decade.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, Smith opposed the Violence Against Women Act, which allows victims of sexual assaults to sue their attackers--and spoke out on the topic at a meeting of the right-wing Federalist Society in 1993.</P>
<P>But there's much, much more about Smith to dislike. Over the years, the appeals court that he's been nominated to join has reversed his decisions more than 50 times.</P>
<P>Take the 1995 case in which the federal government sued the state of Pennsylvania over substandard conditions in a home for the mentally retarded. Although, in Smith's own words, conditions were "frequently not optimal" at the home--maggots were found in one resident's ear--he ruled that the state had no constitutional obligation to require that conditions be improved.</P>
<P>In 1997, Smith oversaw the trial of Mid-State Bank when it was implicated in defrauding dozens of Pennsylvania schools and municipalities. Even though his wife Karen was a Mid-State Bank officer, it took him a month to take himself off the case.</P>
<P>In another of his overturned rulings, Smith threw out a suit by the parents of a 15-month-old child who sued Playskool after their child choked to death on a toy.</P>
<P>Then there's Smith's string of anti-worker decisions--like the one involving the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act. He ruled that forcing a company to pay benefits that retired miners had rightfully earned constituted an illegal taking of the company's property.</P>
<P>This is the type of slimy character that Bush wants running every court in the land. And Democrats are helping him do it. As Sen. Joe Biden Jr. (D-Del.) put it, "I'd like to vote against this guy, [but] I don't have a sufficient reason."</P>
