<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</P></B></I>
<P>The other day, someone sent me a racist cartoon via e-mail. The cartoon characterized Arabs as technology-hating, anti-American buffoons. This is only one example of the many racist e-mails that I've seen since September 11.</P>
<P>Before September 11, inroads had been made against racist jokes and comments in the workplace and at school. But bigots have used the attacks as a cover for hate.</P>
<P>Now, it seems that it's considered okay to distribute openly racist caricatures and articles. There are even computer games where the goal is to shoot turban-wearing Afghans, camels and Osama bin Laden. We can't stand for this!</P>
<P>In response to the e-mail, I replied to all of its recipients. I compared the racist cartoon with those used against the Japanese during the Second World War. I got many supportive e-mails in response.</P>
<P>We must turn back the tide of hate and take a stand against racism. That's why I wear the ISO's "Being Arab Is Not a Crime" button for everyone to see.</P>
