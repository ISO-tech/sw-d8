<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>EBENEZER SCROOGE would have been proud.</P>
<P>Over the holidays, aircraft giant Boeing announced that it was speeding up its layoff plans and will ax 25,000 jobs within six months. At Motorola, management said in mid-December that it would lay off another 9,400 workers. All told, the telecommunications company has shed nearly one-third of its workforce since August 2000.</P>
<P>"It definitely was taboo to lay people off before the holidays, but no more," said Thomas Kochan, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management. And Boeing and Motorola's holiday greetings to workers were only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
<P>Over the past year, corporate layoffs nearly tripled, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the consulting firm that tracks job cuts. "This year, the downsizing just dwarfs anything we've seen before," said chief executive John Challenger.</P>
<P>And what will the new year bring? Motorola predicts "further ongoing and rigorous efforts to improve efficiency and competitiveness."</P>
<P>Translation: throwing workers to the wolves.</P>
<P>"Sadly, I'm in the airline industry," Laurie told <I>Socialist Worker</I> as she waited in line at an unemployment office in Chicago. Laurie worked in a sales office until she was laid off on December 21--for the second time in the past year.</P>
<P>"We had two weeks notice," she said. "When you look at what happened at places like United, folks worked there for 20 years, and good-bye--no severance, nothing. A lot of people are taking pay freezes just to keep their jobs."</P>
<P>And that's not all. In the last three months, more than half a million people lost health care insurance, most of them as the result of layoffs, according to a December report by Families USA, a nonprofit health care advocacy group. And this isn't to mention the millions of people who work full-time--and don't have health insurance.</P>
<P>You'd think that Washington would respond to this wave of layoffs and cutbacks with the same urgency that they passed a multibillion-dollar bailout for the airline bosses--or antiterrorism legislation that shreds our civil liberties.</P>
<P>Yet Republicans and Democrats walked out of Congress last month without making a single plan to help the growing number of workers who got a pink slip for the holidays.</P>
<P>So much for "Americans pulling together" after September 11. The politicians proved once again that they care most about preserving the profits of their corporate backers--no matter what the cost to workers.</P>
