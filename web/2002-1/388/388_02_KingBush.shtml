<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>THE BUSH gang must think they can get away with anything. In December, the White House invoked "executive privilege" to block a congressional investigation of the FBI's Boston office--concerning a case from almost 40 years ago!</P>
<P>The House Government Reform Committee requested internal Justice Department records as part of an ongoing probe into the FBI's dealings with mob informants during the 1960s. In particular, the committee is looking into a 1965 murder trial where agents lied on the witness stand and refused to turn over evidence that would have exonerated the defendants.</P>
<P>As a result, four innocent men were sent to prison. Two died in jail, and the others spent more than 30 years each behind bars before finally being released. Yet the Bush administration had the gall to block a congressional subpoena.</P>
<P>That was too much even for right-wing kook Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.). Burton blasted a Justice Department flunky sent to relay Bush's order.</P>
<P>"You tell the president there's going to be war," Burton said. "We've got a dictatorial president and a Justice Department that doesn't want Congress involved&#133;Your guy's acting like he's king."</P>
