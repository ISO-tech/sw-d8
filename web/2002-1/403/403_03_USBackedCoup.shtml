<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>"WHEN IS a coup not a coup?" asked the <I>New York Times'</I> Tim Weiner. "When the United States says so, it seems--especially if the fallen leader is no friend to American interests." Weiner perfectly captured the lying-through-their-teeth hypocrisy of the Bush gang and their support for the would-be dictators who briefly seized power in Venezuela last week.</P>
<P>The details will be years in coming out, but make no mistake--the U.S. was up to its eyeballs in the plot to topple Venezuela's Hugo Ch&aacute;vez Frias. For months before, a parade of Venezuelan government and business leaders trooped to the U.S. embassy in Caracas, seeking support for action against Ch&aacute;vez.</P>
<P>Many of the coup makers got their "training" at the National Endowment for Democracy, a longtime front for CIA covert operations. And two of the top military brass involved were graduates of the U.S. Army's School of Assassins training camp for Latin American dictators.</P>
<P>The Bush gang concluded that its interests--in ensuring "stability" in the third-largest oil supplier to the U.S.--overlapped with this motley bunch.</P>
<P>Though he came to power on the strength of promises to bring change, Ch&aacute;vez has mostly gone along with Washington's free-market economic demands. But his criticism of Washington's foreign policy--from Plan Colombia to the "war on terror"--and his ties to Cuba's Fidel Castro put him in the crosshairs for a Bush administration packed with veterans of the U.S. government's 1980s dirty wars in Latin America.</P>
<P>When Ch&aacute;vez was placed under arrest, the White House lost no time in recognizing the coup plotters. Apparently, the fact that Ch&aacute;vez was the democratically elected president of the country was a mere formality. For its part, the U.S. media focused obsessively on the impact on gas prices--speculating hopefully that the new regime might pull Venezuela out of OPEC.</P>
<P>But the coup makers overreached by suspending the constitution and dissolving the National Assembly. This split the forces that backed the coup--just as thousands of ordinary Venezuelans were taking to the streets in protest.</P>
<P>Ch&aacute;vez returned to the presidential palace--and the White House was left muttering that this had been a warning to negotiate with the "democratic opposition."</P>
<P>Now the U.S. is in trouble with Latin American governments that it has lectured about "democracy." Even staunch U.S. allies like Mexico refused to recognize a new government in Venezuela until one was chosen by free elections. But when "democracy" and "U.S. interests" collide, democracy always loses out.</P>
<P>By defeating the coup, ordinary Venezuelans proved that they were more committed to democracy than the U.S. government or its lackeys in Venezuela.</P>
