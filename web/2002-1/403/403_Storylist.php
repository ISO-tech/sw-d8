<A HREF="403_01_StopBushWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Stop Bush's war machine</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Sometimes brute force can be useful," said Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, explaining why his bosses in the Bush administration want to add nuclear weapons to their insane Star Wars missile defense scheme. But Kadish's words could just as easily be the motto for the Bush gang's drive to war around the globe.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"It is the end of life." That's how one dazed man described the carnage and destruction as he fled from the Jenin refugee camp that Israel Defense Forces soldiers turned into a slaughterhouse.</P>

<A HREF="403_03_USCheersIsrael.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Cheering on Israel's war</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When Lebanese fascist militias massacred up to 2,000 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp in 1982, an Israeli inquiry found Ariel Sharon to be "indirectly responsible." Twenty years later, Sharon is directly responsible for another massacre of Palestinians--this time in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"When is a coup not a coup?" asked the <I>New York Times'</I> Tim Weiner. "When the United States says so, it seems." Weiner perfectly captured the lying-through-their-teeth hypocrisy of the Bush gang and their support for the would-be dictators who briefly seized power in Venezuela last week.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">No Israeli defense of its war on Palestinians would be complete without a reference to Yasser Arafat's supposed rejection of "peace" at the Camp David summit hosted by Bill Clinton. But the facts are very different, as Naseer Aruri, author of <I>The Obstruction of Peace</I>, explains.</P>

<P><A HREF="403_06_ResistIsraelFist.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Resisting Israel's iron fist</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Israeli civilians are "murdered." Palestinian civilians are "caught in the crossfire." This is the double standard of the U.S. mainstream media. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The only just solution is a democratic and secular Palestine, with equal rights for all. Achieving this will mean confronting Israel; its backer, U.S. imperialism; and the corrupt and dictatorial Arab states that collaborate with the U.S.</P>

<A HREF="403_04_CounterIsraelLies.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Countering their lies</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For most people in the U.S., who rely exclusively on the mass media for news, the crisis in the Middle East appears remote--a tragic "cycle of violence" that U.S. leaders have repeatedly tried to stop without success. But the mainstream news media has withheld the information most crucial to understanding the conflict.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Even as U.S. politicians declared their bipartisan support for Israel, thousands of people took to the streets across the country to show their solidarity with Palestinians.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Anyone who still believes that George W.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dr. Sami Al-Arian is a computer science professor at the University of South Florida who became the target of a witch-hunt after Fox News' right-wing talk show host Bill O'Reilly branded him a "terrorist."
