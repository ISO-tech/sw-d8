<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By a UFT member</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> | April 19, 2002 | Page 15</font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>NEW YORK--A state fact finding panel released its nonbinding recommendations for a contract settlement for New York City teachers April 10. While the panel recommended that teachers be given a raise, it falls well below what the union requested and includes concessions, most notably an extended workday.</P>
<P>Members of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) have been working for 17 months without a contract since the last contract expired in November 2000. The panel was appointed last year after the union and the city had reached an impasse in negotiations.</P>
<P>The panel argued that while the teachers did deserve a raise to bridge the gap with the surrounding districts that earn 20-30 percent more than New York City teachers, it also stated that the city should not give raises beyond the "pattern" that had been established in other contracts with municipal workers.</P>
<P>So while the union had asked for a 22.7 percent raise to achieve parity with teachers in neighboring suburban districts, the panel proposed a 9 percent raise over 27 months. This would include 4 percent retroactive to November 2000, with an additional 5 percent 14 or 15 months later.</P>
<P>In addition to this raise, the panel suggested lengthening the workday by an additional 20 minutes in exchange for a 6 percent pro-rata pay raise. The union has indicated that it might accept the extended day. "At first blush, it looks like the parameters of a settlement," UFT President Randi Weingarten told the <I>New York Times</I>.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, many teachers are opposed to any lengthening of the school day. It means that we aren't really getting a raise, but are being paid for extra work. This does nothing to close the gap with teachers in surrounding suburban districts.</P>
<P>While it is true that, on average, teachers in surrounding areas work longer days, they earn 20-30 percent more than New York City teachers. They also have smaller class sizes and better working conditions overall. The extended workday for a 6 percent raise would only bridge the gap in the length of the workday--while the pay gap gets even wider.</P>
<P>At a time when there is already a shortage of teachers in New York City and teachers are severely overworked and underpaid, lengthening the workday is unacceptable. Teachers should say "no" to an extended day and fight for a real raise with no givebacks.</P>
