<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ever since the U.S. air war on Afghanistan ended, the Bush gang has made it clear that their "war against terror" is headed for Baghdad. But this will be only the latest phase in a U.S. war on Iraq that has lasted more than a decade.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What country stockpiles nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, but refuses to allow international inspections of its facilities? George W. Bush and friends want you to believe the answer is Iraq. But the right answer is closer to home.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. wasn't always opposed to Saddam Hussein having chemical weapons.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. is accepting job applications--for the position of dictator of Iraq. The frontrunners are crooks and war criminals.</P>
