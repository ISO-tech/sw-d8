<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>THE U.S. wasn't always opposed to Saddam Hussein having chemical weapons. Back in the days when Iraq was a U.S. ally--during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s--aid from Washington helped to fund Saddam's chemical weapons program.</P>
<P>The Iraqi regime got its store of anthrax from an American company--with the approval of the U.S. government.</P>
<P>And when Saddam used chemical weapons against Iran during the war--and then against Kurdish villages in northern Iraq--"lovers of democracy" in the Reagan White House looked the other way.</P>
