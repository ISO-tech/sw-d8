<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In Chicago, Boston, Detroit, and other cities and states across the U.S., budget cutters are getting a message from protesters: We're not going to take it. </P>

<A HREF="399_06_ImmigrantDetainees.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The disappeared</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Why am I imprisoned? Why in solitary confinement? And why under maximum security measures?...What are they accusing me of? Nobody knows."

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Apparently, a war movie counts as "realistic" if the blood and dismemberment look "real"--even if it fails to say anything honest about the war it's supposed to be depicting.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Robert Mugabe proclaimed himself the leader of Zimbabwe this week after "winning" an election by means of force and fraud.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Maybe the jurors thought that they were making a just "compromise" when they condemned Andrea Yates to life in prison instead of death. But the guilty verdict against Yates in Houston last week was an appalling injustice.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The world is full of divisions, where groups of people are treated as second-class citizens because of some particular characteristic.
