<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>Currently, I'm detained at Cook County Jail in Chicago. Your readers may know me as one of five inmates severely beaten by racist guards on July 29, 2000 (<I>SW,</I> September 1, 2000). I am also one of the first people in Illinois to fall victim to a videotaped statement that was actually coerced by prosecutors and detectives.</P>
<P>Ask yourself about the circumstances that I underwent for nearly five days before being forced to make that false statement.</P>
<P>I was arrested on July 31, 1999, with no probable cause. From then until August 5, 1999, I was tortured, beaten and threatened. I received no food, water, bathroom visits or phone calls. Daily, I was cuffed to a wall and given information about the crime they wanted me to confess to.</P>
<P>During trial, I testified about the circumstances I faced, and my attorney provided evidence that I was beaten, showing photos and pointing out my injuries that were caught on the videotaped confession. We also got prosecutors and police to admit that I was charged after the statement on August 5.</P>
<P>Even so, my trial judge gave major favors to the state, allowing every unjust measure they raised, including the false testimony of a detective. But the judge did not even allow full testimony from a witness on my behalf.</P>
<P>On Friday, January 4, 2002, video confessions were proven unreliable and insufficient when 25-year-old Corinthian Bell of Chicago was exonerated after being held 17 months in Cook County Jail, based on a coerced and false videotaped confession. In both of our cases, they didn't tape the entire interrogation process.</P>
<P>This proves that the Chicago Police Department and prosecutors rely on coercion, abuse and frame-ups.</P>
<B><P>Edward Mitchell,</B> Chicago</P>
