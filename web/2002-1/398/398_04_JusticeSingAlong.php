<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>THINGS ARE getting bad at the Justice Department these days. Not only does Attorney General John Ashcroft make his staff endure a daily prayer meeting, but he's also making them participate in sing-alongs.</P>
<P>A group of Hispanic Justice Department employees recently were summoned to Ashcroft's office, thinking that perhaps their boss was attempting to open a discussion about how to make the Justice Department more diverse.</P>
<P>Instead, Ashcroft handed them copies of a patriotic song he had written called "Let the Eagle Soar"--and commanded them to translate it into Spanish.</P>
<P>Ashcroft is so proud of his "musical achievement" that some Justice Department staffers are complaining that he hands out copies at meetings and strong-arms employees into singing along.</P>
<P>"Have you heard the song?" one employee asked a reporter. "It really sucks."</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>HOW DO you make over your image when you have the worst human rights record of any military in the Western hemisphere? Get an inflatable mascot!</P>
<P>The Colombian military--which is currently in the process of bombing a 16,000-mile zone in the southern part of the country--is concerned that citizens don't see it as "friendly enough."</P>
<P>So the army recently revealed its new 10-foot-tall inflatable mascot--a soldier dressed in military fatigues. The giant grinning figure has a real soldier inside--whose job is to go around hugging civilians to get them to "trust" the military.</P>
<P>"Remember, your army loves you," the cartoonish character told townspeople as they waited to cross a military checkpoint. "Join in by denouncing these bandits who are killing this country."</P>
