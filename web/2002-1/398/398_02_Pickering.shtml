<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>WHAT WOULD you call a judge who sought a lighter sentence for someone convicted of burning a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple? Wait--don't answer yet.</P>
<P>You should also know that, earlier in his career, this same man pledged his commitment to the "Southern way of life," tried to block desegregation efforts, and wrote a student article describing how Mississippi could strengthen its ban on interracial marriages.</P>
<P>You might call Mississippi Federal Judge Charles Pickering a racist. But George W. Bush calls him "a good, good, honorable citizen." Bush nominated Pickering for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</P>
<P>No wonder the White House likes this bigot. Pickering--who once said that the principle of "one person, one vote" is "obtrusive"--is a well-rounded right-winger. In addition to defending racists, he led a fight in 1976 to get the Republican National Convention to adopt an anti-abortion platform and to condemn the Supreme Court's <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision.</P>
<P>Sen. Orrin Hatch, the leading Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is expected to reject Pickering's nomination, dared to compare Democratic criticisms of Pickering to a "lynching." But it's Pickering, not his critics, who knows something about lynching.</P>
