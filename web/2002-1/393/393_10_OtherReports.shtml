<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>SACRAMENTO--On January 29, teachers, students, parents and union activists rallied to defend education funding.</P>
<P>Protesters rallied against proposed cuts in education spending and put politicians on alert that California kids deserve essential supplies and proper building facilities, and that teachers deserve decent wages.</P>
<P>California has been in a recession since spring of 2001 due to low exports, a decline in manufacturing and the dot-com bust. As of November, Gov. Gray Davis had proposed a $5.2 billion spending reduction.</P>
<P>The need for more money to be allocated toward education is painfully clear. As teacher Matt Behnke told <I>Socialist Worker</I>, "I would be excited just to have enough dry-erase markers!"</P>
<P>Our teachers and our kids deserve better than this!</P>
