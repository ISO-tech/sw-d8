<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">First organized a year ago around the theme "Another world is possible," this year's World Social Forum drew some 40,000 people from across the globe to Porto Alegre, Brazil--and sharpened the international debate on what that new world should look like.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If it were all put in a movie, Rush Limbaugh would be hyperventilating about Hollywood's left-wing conspiracy mongering.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Those who rule will not give up their power peacefully.
