<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>ZIMBABWE'S ROBERT Mugabe cracked down on student protesters and other activists last week after stealing the presidential election.</P>
<P>Mugabe rejected efforts by Nigerian and South African leaders to promote a unity government between his ZANU-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), a party with origins in the unions, but which is now also supported by wealthy white farmers and businesspeople, as well as Britain and the U.S.</P>
<P>Instead, Mugabe proceeded with a treason case against MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who would have won the election two weeks ago if not for a campaign of fraud and violence by the authorities and ZANU-PF thugs.</P>
<P>When last week's general strike, called by the Zimbabwe Confederation of Trade Unions, fizzled because of poor preparation and police intimidation, the authorities stepped up their attacks.</P>
<P>Among those arrested were six members of the International Socialist Organization-Zimbabwe (ISO-Z) in Bulwayo, who were viciously beaten by police, kept in a filthy cell and denied food other than what visitors brought them.</P>
<P>MDC leaders like Tsvangirai look to sanctions from Washington and London to put pressure on Mugabe to hold new elections or step down. But a minority, including some union leaders, student groups and political organizations like the ISO-Z, argue for stepping up the struggle by linking the fight for democracy to workers' economic demands.</P>
