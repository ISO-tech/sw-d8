<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>ROY MOORE is at it again. Last week, the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court wrote that homosexuality was "abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature's God"--and in an official court document, to boot.</P>
<P>This is the same man who insisted on hanging a copy of the Ten Commandments on his courtroom wall--in violation of the U.S. Constitution that he allegedly upholds and interprets.</P>
<P>Now, the religious right has a new reason to champion Moore--his gay-bashing opinion in a child custody case. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court awarded primary custody of three children to the father, over their mother, who is a lesbian.</P>
<P>Moore authored a long opinion agreeing with the decision--called a concurring opinion--in which he declared that gays and lesbians were an "inherent evil against which children must be protected" and that they were "presumptively unfit to have custody of minor children."</P>
<P>Ken Baker, of the gay rights group Equality Begins at Home, said that Moore's words were an invitation to violence. "He knows the power of words like 'inherently evil,'" Baker said. "All he didn't do was hand out the rope."</P>
