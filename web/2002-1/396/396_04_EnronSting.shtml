<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>ABOUT 20 Royal Marines accidentally strayed off course during training exercises off the coast of Gibraltar--and ended up storming a beach in Spain.</P>
<P>The soldiers were carrying 60mm mortars and SA80 assault rifles and took up positions on the beach. But instead of being fired on with blank rounds by fellow British soldiers pretending to be the enemy, the directionally challenged marines found themselves being stared at by startled local fishermen.</P>
<P>According to a British Ministry of Defense spokesperson, the marines "disembarked for about five minutes and then the error was recognized and they all withdrew."</P>
