<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="405_01_HealthCare.shtml">Health care: Denied</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Liz Carvin thought she had affordable health care. The wages at her janitor's job were low, but the health plan made up for it. Then CalPERS--the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which administers her health plan--announced that premiums were going up by 25 percent.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As many as 1 million people are expected to take to the streets in France on May Day to show their disgust and horror at Nazi Jean-Marie Le Pen--the culmination of a week and a half of protests in which masses of people have said no to France's fascists.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="405_05_StopLePen.shtml">How can Le Pen be stopped?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Le Pen's opponent Jacques Chirac wants voters to support him to protect France's "honor" and "democracy," and Socialist Party leaders have echoed this call. But a vote for Chirac to defeat Le Pen is mistaken.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"A hopeful day," thanks to Israel's "constructive and helpful" dedication to peace, George W. Bush declared last weekend. But even as Bush was patting himself on the back for getting Israel to release Yasser Arafat from a month-old military siege, Israeli tanks were plowing into the West Bank city of Hebron to wreak more devastation.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="405_03_NoRecovery.shtml">No recovery for workers</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush hailed the latest economic statistics as "a good sign that we're on the path to long-term recovery." But the business press and CEOs had a different message: Even if the recession is really over, hard times for workers are not.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>A fighting tradition that stands for international solidarity</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="405_08_MarxismRelevant.shtml">Is Marxism relevant in the Third World?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Critics of Karl Marx often dismiss him as a "dead, white, European man" whose ideas don't apply to--or are even at odds with--the majority of people around the world who are nonwhite. But the opposite is true--Marxism offers a solution for ending poverty and suffering around the world that's even more relevant today.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON?</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="405_07_USWorkers.shtml">Are U.S. workers part of the problem?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">With only 4 percent of the world's population, the U.S.'s per-capita consumption is 14 times greater than low-income countries with 40 percent of the world's population. Taken at face value, these statistics seem to demonstrate that the vast majority of the U.S. population are part of the problem, not the solution. But this view is profoundly mistaken.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="405_09_IdeasChange.shtml">How do workers' ideas change?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The richest fifth of Americans have nine times more wealth than the poorest fifth, and the wealthiest 1 percent of U.S. society has 38 percent of the nation's wealth. Why don't the vast majority, whose labor makes such obscene wealth possible, take the 1 percent "by the throat"?</P>
