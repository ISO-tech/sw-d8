<A HREF="408_01_BushWarLies.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Why won't they tell the truth?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The White House is reeling from revelations that top officials had information about the September 11 attacks before they happened. But in focusing on the blunders of the government's security apparatus, Washington won't look at the questions that <I>should</I> be asked.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Florida girl lost in privatized system</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="408_12_CostOfTheirCuts.shtml">The cost of their cuts</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It took 15 months for Florida's Department of Children and Families (DCF) to discover that 5-year-old Rilya Wilson was missing from her foster home. But it took only a few minutes for Gov. Jeb Bush to blame DCF workers.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush is seeing red. His administration is packed with right-wingers who were furious over former President Jimmy Carter's visit to Cuba last week, so Bush spoke out this week to assure right-wingers that the U.S. embargo won't be lifted.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The "war against terror" will last for years, says the Bush administration. And as long it does, the list of victims of the government's witch-hunt against Muslims and people of Arab descent will grow. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="408_06_RabihHaddad.shtml">"Rabih Haddad is an innocent man"</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Rabih Haddad has spent more five months behind bars as a victim of John Ashcroft's witch-hunt. His brother Mazen Haddad talked to <I>Socialist Worker</I> about Rabih's case and the fight to free him.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The new arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia will "liquidate the Cold War," says George W. Bush. But the deal won't make the world any safer--and it gives Washington a free hand to replace the Cold War with a series of hot ones.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Israel's supporters understand the truth behind the old saying that the best defense is a good offense. That's why they're trying to label supporters of Palestinian rights as anti-Semites.</P>
