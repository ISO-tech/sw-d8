<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Stop U.S. aid to Israel</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_01_StopIsraelsTerror.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Stand up against Israel's terror</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Corpses piled up in the morgues or left rotting in the streets. Ambulances barred at checkpoints, while the wounded bleed to death. Palestinians kept prisoners in their own homes by Israel's siege. This was the reality in the Israeli-occupied West Bank amid the most savage military assault on Palestinians in two decades.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Free all the detainees now!</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_12_FreeDetainees.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Being Arab is not a crime</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Of the approximately 2,000 immigrants detained in the aftermath of September 11, not a single one was found to have any connection to the attacks. But that didn't stop the Justice Department from victimizing many for minor visa or other violations.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>ISRAEL'S WAR ON PALESTINIANS</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Trapped in her own house by Israel's siege:</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_02_WeWontGiveUp.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"We won't give up"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Suzanne Abu Tair lives in Bethlehem and works as a nurse in the nearby Dheisheh refugee camp. She talked to <I>Socialist Worker</I> about the desperate conditions that Palestinians face today.</P>

<P><A HREF="402_02_IsraelProtests.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Taking to the streets to protest Israel</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">People across the country took to the streets last week to protest Israel's war on Palestinians. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>WHAT WE THINK</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Taking sides in a battle between oppressor and oppressed</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_03_SideWithPalestine.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>We stand with the Palestinians</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This week marks the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943, in which the lightly armed Jewish Fighting Organization heroically resisted Nazi armed forces. Today, lightly armed Palestinians are heroically resisting the onslaught of the Israel Defense Forces. But the Palestinians are reviled as "terrorists."</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>WHAT WE THINK</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_03_PeaceMakerForWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>"Peacemaker" who's out for blood</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many names come to mind when you think of George W. Bush. "Peacemaker" should <I>not</I> be one of them. But that's how Bush tried to appear as he sent Secretary of State Colin Powell to the Middle East last week.</P>

<P><A HREF="402_08_SharonIsTerrorist.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Ariel Sharon: This man is the real terrorist</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The state of Israel came into existence a half-century ago--and has maintained itself ever since--through terror, warfare and the illegal seizure of Palestinian lands. And Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has had blood on his hands from the very beginning.</P>

<P><A HREF="402_09_NewIntifadaReview.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Roots of the new Palestinian Intifada</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Most stories about Israel's war refer to the start of the Palestinian uprising, or Intifada, 18 months ago. But this is only the latest stage in a rich history of struggle for justice.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>READING BETWEEN THE LINES</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_09_MediaLiesOnIsrael.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Media miseducation about Israel's barbarism</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 1991 survey showed that the more people watched TV news about the Gulf War against Iraq, the more pro-war they became--and the less they actually learned about the war. Multiply that effect by 10, and you have the mainstream media's coverage of Israel's war against the Palestinian people.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Producing a socialist newspaper is about more than telling the truth. We want to convince readers not only about what's wrong with the world--but that they need to act to change it.</P>

<P><A HREF="402_06_SWAt25.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><i>Socialist Worker</i> turns 25</b></font></A><BR>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Washington D.C., April 19-22 &#151; San Francisco, April 20</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_05_WhyProtest.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Why we're protesting</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Activists across the country are mobilizing for protests in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. The demonstrations were called over a range of issues, but they are linked by a common thread--opposition to the U.S. government's imposition of its military and economic power around the globe. Here, <i>SW</i> talks to leading activists about why they're protesting.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>ISSUES IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_11_ULLICOCorruption.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>ULLICO spells union corruption</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When the AFL-CIO posted a Web page on "Curbing Corporate Greed" three years ago, Union Labor Life Insurance Co. (ULLICO) got a nod as a pro-worker alternative. But it turns out that the top union officials on the ULLICO board of directors were indulging in some corporate greed themselves.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>INSIDE THE SYSTEM</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="402_04_SEIUVoodoo.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The curse of the union</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Why would workers at the Mt. Sinai-St. Francis Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Miami, Fla., vote in favor of union representation? Could it be the long hours and low wages? Lack of good benefits? Not at all, according to management. It's because the union used voodoo to scare Haitian workers into voting union.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Recently declassified documents have exposed the U.S. government's bloody role in the decades-long civil war in the African country of Angola.</P>

<P><A HREF="402_02_CopQuotas.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Arrest quota is a recipe for profiling</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The head of the Chicago Police Department unit that patrols the Cabrini-Green public housing project on the city's Near North Side decided that his officers weren't "productive" enough. So he demanded more arrests from his cops--and implemented monthly quotas to make sure he got them.</P>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>ON THE PICKET LINE</b></font></p>

<P><A HREF="402_12_Accuride.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Abandoned by the UAW at Accuride</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It took just a 19-word letter for the United Auto Workers (UAW) to abandon more than 400 workers in a local with a 23-year history of struggle--the last four years in a brutal lockout.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>UPS pleads poverty despite strong performance</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="402_11_UPSContract.shtml">"We've got a fight at UPS"</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Contract negotiations between United Parcel Service and the Teamsters are heating up. UPS has had five record profit years since the last contract, but management is trying to convince union workers that UPS is under siege from the U.S. Post Office and FedEx.</P>

<P><A HREF="402_11_LockheedMartin.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Lockheed Martin</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To listen to the mainstream media here, you would think the month-long Lockheed Martin strike was about to collapse. Workers say differently. "Personally I'm prepared to stay out as long as it takes," Marvis Kight, who has worked at Lockheed Martin for 39 years, told <I>Socialist Worker</I>.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Attorney General John Ashcroft's racist scapegoating of immigrants has given renewed confidence to racist police from the same precinct where Haitian immigrant Abner Louima was tortured in 1997.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In its effort to sell the public on a permanent state of war, the Bush administration has called upon Americans to "sacrifice" in the name of patriotism. Too bad that call doesn't extend to large corporations.</P>
