<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By Randy Childs</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>LONG BEACH, Calif.--A multiracial crowd of 200 people marched through downtown February 9 to protest the police murder of Marcella Byrd, a 57-year-old African American woman. Byrd's daughter Angela and son Tirus joined the protesters.</P>
<P>Several Long Beach police officers surrounded Marcella Byrd on January 19. Police claim that Byrd, a diagnosed schizophrenic less than five feet tall, threatened them with a kitchen knife. They opened fire, hitting her with at least 10 bullets.</P>
<P>Speakers at the protest compared Byrd's killing with a Los Angeles case. Margaret Mitchell was also small, middle-aged and mentally ill when several LAPD officers shot her three years ago, claiming deadly force was needed because she "threatened" them with a screwdriver.</P>
<P>Neighborhood residents cheered the protesters when they marched past the place where the cops killed Byrd. Protesters also stopped outside police headquarters.</P>
<P>It will take more activism like this to make the Long Beach police pay for what they did to Marcella Byrd.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Abolish the death penalty</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By Noreen McNulty</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>CHICAGO--The Campaign to End the Death Penalty picketed a debate between the candidates for Illinois governor February 18. About 40 people gathered to send the message that the death penalty is too flawed to fix!</P>
<P>All six of the Illinois gubernatorial candidates are pro-death penalty--though several are also claiming to support the moratorium on executions declared by current Illinois Gov. George Ryan. Candidate Pat O'Malley, a Republican, opposes the moratorium and claims it is illegal.</P>
<P>Once Gov. Ryan's commission on the death penalty releases its recommendations on how to "fix" the death penalty, it will be all too easy for a pro-death penalty governor to reinstate the death penalty.</P>
<P>Leaks to the press report that the commission voted 8 to 5 for abolition of the death penalty, but it's not yet clear if this recommendation will be included in its final report.</P>
<P>Four of the six remaining gubernatorial candidates met at National-Louis University for a moderated debate about the education system in Illinois--where activists turned out to give them an education in grassroots opposition!</P>
<P>Even though several activists were on the list of approved attendees, they were barred from entering because of the protest. But we'll be dogging the candidates throughout the governor's race--to kick off a season of activism to push for abolition in 2002.</P>
<P>We won't go back--abolition now!</P>
