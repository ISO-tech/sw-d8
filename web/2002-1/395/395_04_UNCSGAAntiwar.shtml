<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</P>
</B></I><P>On February 13, the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Greensboro's Student Government Association (SGA) debated a resolution concerning the events of September 11 and George W. Bush's "war on terrorism."</P>
<P>On the whole, the resolution says that the UNC-Greensboro campus supports the war and congratulates the U.S. military on its "victory."</P>
<P>Thankfully, the SGA resolution to support the war was not passed! In fact, the author of the resolution, the parliamentarian of the SGA, was the only person to vote "yes." The other 40 to 50 voting delegates of the SGA voted against the resolution.</P>
<P>Everyone that stood up to debate, including some people who were not antiwar activists, was opposed to it, and said so. Not only were they opposed to the war, they also believed that it isn't the SGA's place to delve into political affairs that have nothing to do with the betterment of the students at UNC-Greensboro.</P>
<P>This was a great victory for our antiwar committee and, in essence, for all of the campus-based antiwar committees across the country. For me to see that there are other people out there (especially in the SGA) that oppose this war is absolutely reassuring.</P>
<P>Antiwar sentiment is strong. We need to tap into that sentiment and get this antiwar movement going strong again!</P>
