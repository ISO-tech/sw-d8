<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_01_AxisOfEvil.shtml">This is the real "axis of evil"</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush has set his sights on Iraq. "This is not an argument about whether to get rid of Saddam Hussein," a senior Bush administration official told the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> last week. "That debate is over. This is&#133;how you do it."</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The Enron scandal</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_12_EnronTipOfIceberg.shtml">Tip of the iceberg</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Enron isn't the half of it. Revelations of more colossal financial scams in Corporate America swept into the news last week amid the bankruptcy of telecommunications company Global Crossing.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_12_SJPConference.shtml">Organizing for justice in Palestine</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">With continued Israeli air strikes and invasions of territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority serving as the backdrop, some 400 students and Palestine solidarity activists attended the Students for Justice in Palestine conference at the University of California-Berkeley last weekend.</P>


<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_06_MediaLapdogs.shtml">Media lapdogs</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Is there any alternative to the mainstream media's pro-war drumbeat? <I>Socialist Worker</I> asked leading voices of the alternative media: David Barsamian, director of Alternative Radio; Amy Goodman, host of "Democracy Now!"; Matthew Rothschild, editor of <I>The Progressive</I>; and Norman Solomon, who writes on media and politics in his syndicated column "Media Beat."</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Brendan Sexton III on what really happened in Somalia</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_08_BrendanSexton.shtml">What's wrong with <I>Black Hawk Down</I></A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the Pentagon brass love <I>Black Hawk Down,</I> the Hollywood movie about a U.S. mission gone wrong during the 1993 occupation of Somalia. But as actor Brendan Sexton III, who appeared in the movie, explains, the real story of the U.S. government's "humanitarian" mission is very different.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_05_BushEducationSham.shtml">Selling schools to the highest bidder</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A couple of years ago, the Republican Party was officially in favor of abolishing the Department of Education. George W. Bush has better public relations advisers. In a new education bill signed into law last month, the Bush administration repackaged Republican attacks on public schools as "reform."</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Growing public disgust with the Enron scandal forced House Republican leaders and their White House masters to allow a vote on campaign finance reform last week. But even if the Shays-Meehan bill becomes law, the system of legalized bribery that drives Washington will go on. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_03_MilosevicTrial.shtml">Hypocrisy in The Hague</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Slobodan Milosevic's trial at The Hague is entering its second week, and Washington is leading the outcry against this "enemy of democracy." But it wasn't always that way. For much of the 1990s, the U.S. government supported Milosevic.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_03_DefendISOZ.shtml">Support the socialists in Zimbabwe</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's crackdown on political opposition took aim at socialists and union activists last week.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Never one to miss out on an opportunity for a little warmongering, Democrat Al Gore jumped on the bash-Iraq bandwagon last week, telling the Council on Foreign Relations in New York that the time had come for a "final reckoning" with Iraq and its leader Saddam Hussein.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush was on hand to wave the flag at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Utah.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If the congressional committees investigating Enron really want to get to the bottom of the scandal, they could begin by hauling in George W. Bush to testify. The entire Bush dynasty has been up to its eyeballs in Enron money and influence since Enron was formed.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="395_09_Nationalization.shtml">Socialism is about workers' control</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For many people, socialism is popularly defined as the degree of state intervention in the economy. The existence of a more or less expansive social safety net may indicate a strong history of class struggle, but concessions wrested from a capitalist state do not render that society socialist.</P>
