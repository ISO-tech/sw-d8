<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">SEATTLE--About 100 truck drivers and supporters rallied to demand a good contract as Teamsters Local 174, the union that represents 600 drivers, threatened to strike two garbage companies that serve King County.<p>
The main issues in the contract are mandatory overtime and an attack on health benefits. The companies are trying to force the employees to shift to an inferior health plan. <p>
Workers are often forced to work 50 to 60-hour weeks--in a very heavy physical job. The companies, Allied Waste/Rabanco and Waste Management, want to save money by not hiring more workers and paying benefits to new employees.<p>
The contract expired March 31, but workers decided to work without a contract for up to two weeks to try to get a new contract. A strike would halt collection of more than 95 percent of garbage in the Seattle area.<p>
The contract dispute here is part of a nationwide struggle. Workers in New York City and Washington, D.C., are also working without contracts while attempting to prevent company demands for concessions. <p>
Workers from each of these cities flew in to join the rally and show solidarity--and were given a warm reception. Workers in the three cities pledged to support each other as they take on Waste Management, a multi-billion dollar corporation.<p>
