<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">SEATTLE--More than 200 people gathered downtown on April 1 to protest the local branch of the anti-immigrant vigilante group, the Minutemen. <p>
The Minutemen had announced on their Web site that they were planning to go to possible different locations in Seattle to harass immigrant day laborers. This included a location downtown, where counter-protesters from many local activist groups first met up--a frequent meeting place for immigrants looking for work in Seattle.<p>
After it was clear that the Minutemen were not going to show up, protestors found out that the Minutemen had planned to go to several Home Depot stores around the Seattle area to confront immigrant workers. In defense, groups of activists organized to travel out to each of these locations, ready to confront the Minutemen.<p>
Fortunately, the Minutemen decided not to show up to any of these locations. Instead, activists turned the counter-protests against the Minutemen into a protest for immigrant rights, holding pro-immigrant signs in the parking lots and on the streets near each location. Many were met with honks from passing cars in support of fellow community members.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">PROVIDENCE, R.I.--Antiwar activists protested and disrupted a speech by Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) at Brown University on April 8. <p>
After receiving no response to their demand that the prowar Democrat meet with Rhode Island military families and Dr. Sureya Sayadi, an Iraqi Kurdish anti-occupation activist touring with the Code Pink Iraqi Women's Delegation, 75 people turned out to rally against Clinton.<p>
Dr. Sayadi spoke before the rally at an antiwar forum at Brown about the horrific results of the U.S. war, supported by leaders of both parties. She also spoke of Hillary Clinton's trip to Iraq, where Clinton praised the building of permanent bases in the country to use as a launching pad to bomb Iran.<p>
Clinton's lecture on "Women and Leadership" was interrupted by antiwar hecklers loudly demanding, "Is it leadership to continue to support Bush's war?" and "What about the women of Falluja?" The speech was interrupted for 10 minutes before police and Secret Service agents physically removed the protesters.<p>
The forum and protest was sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee, Brown Faculty and Students Against the Occupation of Iraq, the Code Pink Iraqi Women's Delegation, the International Socialist Organization, Military Families Speak Out, and the R.I. Community Coalition for Peace.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">CINCINNATI--Approximately 50 antiwar activists from the Intercommunity Justice and Peace Center, Iraq Veterans Against the War and the newly formed chapter of the Campus Antiwar Network gathered outside the Great American Ballpark in frigid, windy conditions to protest President Bush's throwing out of the first pitch at the Cincinnati Reds baseball game on opening day. <p>
Bush's presence in the city forced the opening day organizers to shut down much of the downtown area--including passage on the river--and to institute a "no-fly" zone over the city. Protest organizers handed out nearly 3,800 leaflets explaining the "Three strikes against the Bush regime," and chanted "Peanuts cost a dollar, this war costs $195 million per day" and "Double play: End the war in Iraq and bring the troops home now!"<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">COLLEGE PARK, Md.--On April 6, 65 students at the University of Maryland (UMD) attended a teach-in entitled "UMD Stands Up for Immigrant Rights: No to HR 4437; Amnesty Now!" <p>
The Latino Student Union, the International Socialist Organization, the Asian American Student Association, and Community Roots put together a panel, fielded questions, and initiated discussion in response to the recent attacks on undocumented workers. Attendees learned that one out of 14 Asian immigrants are undocumented, and that 75 percent of citizens are against the building of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.<p>
After listening to ISO member Derron Thweatt unapologetically advocate amnesty, students discussed the provisions of HR 4437, the history of civil strife in Central and South America and its connection to U.S. imperialism, and the importance of standing against the racist intentions of all proposed "compromise" bills.<p>
The discussion finally ended with a call for UMD students to mobilize on April 10 in Washington D.C. With more than 11 million undocumented workers directly affected by the on-going war on immigrants, we must unite against this unjustified witch-hunt against innocent people.<p>
