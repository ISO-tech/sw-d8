<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">EDUCATION SECRETARY Rod Paige grabbed headlines last month when he called the nation's largest teachers' union a "terrorist organization." What was the National Education Association's (NEA) "crime"? Opposing the Bush administration's education policy--in particular, the No Child Left Behind Act passed two years ago. After an uproar in the media, Paige was forced to take back his slander--but he repeated his denunciation of NEA leaders who "use fear, distortions, misinformation and disruptive tactics."</P>
<P>The real crime is the No Child Left Behind Act itself. The law sets draconian standards and requires complicated procedures, all designed to label schools, teachers and students as "failures."</P>
<P>The cornerstone of the legislation is never-ending testing. Based on these tests, schools are rated on a scale from exemplary to low performing--with low-performing schools suffering a range of punishments. This is bad enough. But the administration has proved just how little it cares about schools by underfunding the new law--to the tune of $27 billion since it was enacted.</P>
<P>As the administration's chief salesperson for No Child Left Behind, Paige has plenty of practice spouting lies and distortions. As the former superintendent of the Houston Independent School District--where he was the only public schools chief in the U.S. to employ a full-time public relations expert--Paige collaborated with then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush to create the fairy tale of the "Texas miracle" in education for inner-city schools.</P>
<P>When he was nominated to be education secretary, the <I>New York Times </I>reported that Paige "led the school district to strong improvement in test scores, a sharply reduced campus crime rate, falling dropout rates...and improvements in management that have saved taxpayers money." But all this was smoke and mirrors. </P>
<P>Last fall, an investigation by the <I>Washington Post </I>uncovered numerous scandals in Houston high schools revolving around underreporting dropout rates. In fact, the <I>Post </I>reported that a Houston schools employee admitted to following a superior's orders to falsify the district's dropout statistics.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Houston high schools routinely inflate scores for tests administered in 10th grade by not allowing students out of 9th grade--before they could lower the statistics. For example, at one high school in 2001, there were 1,160 students in 9th grade--and just 281 students in 10th grade. A <I>New York Times </I>investigation into differences between state-administered achievement test scores and SAT results concluded that while "88 percent of Houston's student body is black and Latino, only a few hundred minority students leave high school 'college ready.'"</P>
<P>Under the No Child Left Behind Act, high crime statistics can result in a school being labeled "persistently dangerous." But Paige's district had a solution for that, too. In the last four years, according to the <I>New York Times, </I>the Houston school district's own police force entered 3,091 assaults into a database shared with city police--but reported only 761 school assaults to the state education agency. One of cases never reported to the state agency was the rape of a 17-year-old disabled student--because the attacker was jailed before he could be expelled from school.</P>
<P>While head of the Houston school district, Paige was known for contracting out many areas of school operations. One major contract was with Community Education Partners (CED)--for a controversial system of alternative education for students who commit school-related felonies. CED was started by politically connected businesspeople from Tennessee and former private prison executives--all with no experience in education. </P>
<P>Paige bragged that CED had raised the average student 2.4 grade levels in reading and 2.1 in math. But a research specialist from the Houston district found exactly the opposite--that after a year at CED, students' test scores went <I>down</I> by one grade level. The specialist lost his job.</P>
<P>Doctored reports and fictitious statistics aren't unique to the Houston school district. They are bound become even more commonplace--because the No Child Left Behind Act sets impossible standards.</P>
<P>No amount of funding--and no amount of appeasement by Democrats like John Kerry, who says he wants to change the law, but not get rid of it--will make No Child Left Behind less terrifying. It's time for teachers, students and parents to organize to give this farce of an education bill the failing grade it deserves.</P>
