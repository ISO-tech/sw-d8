<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Mumia book barred in Indiana</b></font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">MUMIA ABU-JAMAL'S new book has been banned by the Indiana prison system. On April 20, state prison officials denied a copy of the Pennsylvania political prisoner's new book--<I>We Want Freedom: A Life in the Black Panther Party</I>--to Zolo Agona Azania, who has spent most of the last 23 years on Indiana's death row.</P>
<P>The Security Threat Group Coordinator of the Indiana Department of Correction confiscated the book, specifically citing one chapter: "The Empire Strikes Back: COINTELPRO." The chapter is based on information from available documents--many of them made public by the federal government itself--and describes the FBI's fanatical campaign against revolutionary groups such as the Panthers.</P>
<P>When asked by the publisher, South End Press, to explain why the book was confiscated, one state prison official said, "Probably because it has gang signs."</P>
<P>This isn't the first time that authorities have tried to silence Mumia--whose death sentence was overturned in 2001, but whose murder conviction was upheld. In particular, Philadelphia police have conducted a fanatical campaign, for example, pressuring National Public Radio to bar Mumia as a commentator in the late 1990s.</P>
