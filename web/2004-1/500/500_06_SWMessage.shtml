<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">May 21, 2004 | Page 6</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">YOU ARE reading the 500th issue of <I>Socialist Worker. </I>That's an important milestone for us. <I>SW </I>first appeared in April 1977 as the newspaper of the newly formed International Socialist Organization. We've come out regularly ever since--first as a monthly, then as a biweekly beginning in November 1994, and as a weekly paper since October 2001.</P>
<P>It's taken the hard work and dedication of a lot of people to get to this point--writers and editors, correspondents around the country sending in reports, our production staff, and all the ISO members who devote time to selling <I>Socialist Worker </I>and spreading its ideas. In the process, we've been privileged to be a part of all kinds of struggles for a better world--in the U.S. and around the globe, big struggles and small ones. </P>
<I><P>Socialist Worker </I>celebrated the fight to end apartheid in South Africa, the Solidarnosc revolt of 10 million workers against Poland's dictatorship, the worldwide movement against both U.S.-led Gulf Wars on Iraq. But <I>SW </I>has also stood up in solidarity with countless other struggles that aren't as well remembered--strikes for justice and respect in the workplace, demonstrations against police brutality and racism, pickets to defend a woman's right to choose abortion.</P>
<P>In the coming weeks, we'll publish a number of features to mark our 500th issue--beginning with this week's interview with Howard Zinn on the socialist press in the U.S., and culminating with a special supplement to appear in early June with excerpts from some of the most memorable articles from our 500-issue past.</P>
<P>One of our biggest hopes for this celebration is to reflect these struggles that <I>SW </I>is proud to have been a part of. We hope our readers will contact us in the coming weeks--with good-luck wishes, messages of solidarity and their thoughts about the importance of publications like SW, which we will collect and publish in the supplement.</P>
<P>We're also asking for donations to a special <I>Socialist Worker </I>fund drive. Money has been a constant concern throughout our first 500 issues, and we'd like to take this opportunity to put our newspaper on a firmer footing heading into the next 500. You can write to us at: <I>Socialist Worker, </I>P.O. Box 16085, Chicago, IL 60616. Or e-mail us at sw@socialistworker.org. Send donations by check or money order to our P.O. box--or donate on our Web site at www.socialistworker.org/Donate.shtml.</P>
<P>We hope you enjoy this celebration of our 500-issue-long past--and we look forward to your continued support as we get started on the next 500.</P>
