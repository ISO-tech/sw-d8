<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Election 2004: What we're reading</b></font><P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By Lance Selfa and Paul D'Amato</b></font><P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How can we understand the roots of George W. Bush's election victory on November 2? <p>

<b>What the polls show</b> <p>

Some insight comes from the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html" target="_blank">exit polls</a> available at CNN.com. Bush's strategy of playing to his base assured that a more conservative electorate showed up at the polls. As many Republicans as Democrats turned up at the polls (37 percent of the total electorate each), compared to 2000, when Democrats held a 39 to 35 percent edge. The pundits will try to say to that conservative rural areas are most responsible for Bush's win, but the data show that Bush actually lost a little ground in rural areas from 2000. But he polled 10 points better <i>in urban areas</i> in 2004 than he did in 2000.<p>
Despite this, 52 percent of voters said that the Iraq war had not made the U.S. more secure; 52 percent said things are going badly in Iraq; 45 percent disapproved of the decision to go to war in Iraq (compared to 51 percent who supported it); 49 percent said the U.S. was going in the right direction (compared to 46 percent saying it's going in the wrong direction); 52 percent said the national economy is "not good or poor"; 49 percent described themselves as 'angry or dissatisfied' with the Bush administration; and 70 percent said they were "very concerned" about the cost of health care. In other words, Bush's record provided a "target-rich environment" for Kerry to exploit, but he couldn't do it. <p>
A large number of people who disagree with various Bush policies and actions voted for him anyway. Why? As a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/politics/campaign/04voices.html" target="_blank"><i>New York Times </i>article</a> on Thursday explains, people who were critical of the Iraq war had no reason to vote for Kerry because he presented himself as a pro-war candidate. Hence, for many, the election resolved itself to: which man is more "likable," more "decisive," and so on. The following quotes say a lot:<p>

<blockquote>
Shannon Bangle, 31, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., said that he thought Mr. Bush falsely linked the war in Iraq to the terrorist attacks of 2001 and that Republican support for a federal constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage was "ridiculous." "The bottom line is I like Bush better as a person," Mr. Bangle said. "The president knows his strength. Visceral is a good word. At the end of the day, I have a strong sense of connection with this president."<p>
In Birchwood, Wis., a small town that split 49.8 percent for Mr. Bush and 49.2 percent for Mr. Kerry, Morris Gillett backed the president. But he was not too enthusiastic about it. "Good Lord of mercy," Mr. Gillett said. "To me, this was the worst campaign ever. I'm 80 and I've been through a lot of elections and this is the worst campaign that I've ever experienced. People talking about each other.  Negative. To me, they were both talking down to the citizens." His biggest concern with Mr. Bush is the war in Iraq. "I almost did not vote for George Bush because he started that war in Iraq, and that was a terrible mistake," Mr. Gillett said. "But then I figured, now that we're in it, we'd better stay with him."<p>
</blockquote>

Kerry's biggest failure came in Ohio, where 62 percent of the voters said the economy was "not good or poor," but split 48/48 over whether Kerry or Bush could fix it! Doug Ireland made this point in his <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=90&amp;ItemID=6562%20" target="_blank">"Why Kerry Lost"</a> on ZNet, where he blasted Kerry for spending the last week of his campaign in Ohio focusing on the missing explosives in Iraq instead of the missing jobs in Ohio. <p>
And on the crucial question on whether Iraq was part of the war on terror, 52 percent said "yes"&#8212;despite their unease or opposition to the Iraqi adventure. As Ireland wrote, "Bush won by making the link between Iraq and the war on terrorism&#8212;the Big Lie which Kerry could not effectively counter, because he's bought into it at the beginning.<p>

<b>Views from the left</b><p>

Reactions to the election from liberals and the left are starting to roll in. And not surprisingly, they reflect the various writers' positions on Anybody But Bush, Kerry and the campaign. <p>
<i>Nation </i>editor Katrina Vanden Heuvel at ABB Central tells us to <a href="http://www.thenation.com/edcut/index.mhtml?bid=7" target="_blank">"Stand and Fight"</a> against the Bush agenda. After criticizing the Kerry campaign for failing to come up with a compelling message, she urges, "We've got to build a politics of conviction, of passion and substance. It's there but it needs to be built and fought for." Her pep talk rings hollow. After all, she and her fellow liberals spent the last two years slandering Ralph Nader&#8212;who certainly represents "a politics of conviction, of passion and substance"&#8212;not to run for president.<p>
Probably the worst article is <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=72&amp;ItemID=6560" target="_blank">"The Morning After"</a> by Justin Podur on ZNet. He blames not the ABB left for its illusions in Kerry, or even Kerry and the Democrats, but the whole U.S. population.
Writers who were highly critical of Kerry provided the best "morning after" commentaries.<p>
Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair's <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn11032004.html" target="_blank">"Who to Blame This Time?"</a> published November 3 on CounterPunch notes that despite a string of Bush failures and the deepening unpopularity of the war, Kerry's vote for the war hamstrung him. "When he tried a chord change at NYU on September 20, it was too late, and even then his position remained incoherent. He offered no way out. More tunnel, no light."<p>
They also note the disastrous impact of ABB on the left. They chide "the grotesque amount of energy" from unions and Democrats that "went into trying to suppress the Nader vote. They did suppress it and this achievement gained them nothing, except, perhaps the destruction of the Green Party."<p>
<i>Socialist Worker's </i>Sharon Smith has a post-election analysis <a href="http://www.socialistworker.org/2004-2/519/519_02_RightWing.shtml" target="_blank">"Right-wing republic?"</a> explaining how the right could have swept the election. It's posted on this site, and <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/smith11042004.html" target="_blank">appears on CounterPunch</a> as well.<p>
Marc Cooper of <i>LA Weekly</i> skewers the Dems for digging their own grave in an article called <a href="http://www.marccooper.com/" target="_blank">"The Democrats Have Met the Enemy"</a>: <p>

<blockquote>
From the onset of his administration, the Democrats have combined a freakish accommodation to Bush with a shrill, sometimes paranoiac exaggeration of his evil. One moment they are part of his War Cabinet. The next they are demonizing him as an individual and warning we are on the doorstep of fascism. And then we blame the voters for being confused&#8230;<p>
Could there possibly have been an incumbent more easy to knock-off than George W. Bush? A real-life opposition party would have been insulted to be matched with such and unworthy and frail rival. The Democrats, by contrast got their lights punched out&#8230;<p>
</blockquote>

Cooper's pre-election article, <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/ink/04/49/dissonance-cooper.php" target="_blank">"The Incidental Candidate,"</a> in which he said we would unhappily vote for a Democrat for the first time since 1972, makes an important point that is worth remembering as we face a second Bush term. He urges his liberal friends "to get their heads around the not-too-complex notion that Bush can win the election and still lose." <p>
<a href="http://www.votenader.com/media_press/index.php?cid=398" target="_blank">Ralph Nader's post-election assessment</a> is worth reading. Nader should have gotten more than .3 percent of the vote, but was abandoned by the ABB left for Kerry. He argues that Kerry lost because the Democrats failed to offer any real alternative. He says that we need to begin organizing&#8212;"yesterday"&#8212;against the occupation of Iraq&#8212;which progressives put on hold for the election.<p>
