<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>"It's like a war here," according to Joe Perry, the sheriff of McCreary County in Kentucky. He was describing the picket lines at the Stearns Justus mine. </P>
<P>In early March, the 200 strikers were told by Frank Thomas, the president of Stearns Mining Co., that unless they returned to work, replacements would be hired. Then, the following Saturday, the Stearns security guards were escorted through the picket lines by state troopers in riot gear. It was after this that the real shooting started. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="500S_197704_LikeAWar.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>On July 28, 1979, the body of 14-year-old Edward Smith, was found on Niskey Lake Drive in southwest Atlanta. He had been shot. Half an hour later, the body of another 14-year-old boy, Alfred Evans, was found 50 yards away. Two children, each 14, found dead within 50 yards of each other on the same day, on the same stretch of road&#150;a cause of concern? A big news story? Yes, but in Atlanta, no one seemed to care.</P>
<P>Ahmed Shawki and Retha Hill wrote this report from Atlanta&#150;then becoming known as the capital of the "new South"&#150;after a string of murders left nearly 30 children dead, all of them African American. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="500S_198107_Atlanta.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>Where I have my biggest problem is with the union hierarchy in Washington. They're just like congressmen and senators. They don't care about human beings. All they care about is themselves and the image they're going to portray to people. And I think that's the biggest problem&#150;that Lane Kirkland didn't go out to the grassroots to see exactly how they felt about PATCO and our strike. I think if he would have, he would have found out that people would have been behind us, and something could have been done.</P>
<P>I don't think the labor movement has learned the lessons of PATCO yet. There was a big lesson to be learned&#150;the first union to be decertified. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="500S_198208_PATCO.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>Marxism is about freedom. It is also about constraint&#150;about the circumstances and conditions that prevent working men and women, the actual producers of all wealth, from controlling the conditions of their own lives and work. And it is about how these circumstances can be changed and how working men and women can create a truly free society in which all contribute according to their ability and receive according to their needs&#150;a society free from exploitation, free from oppression, free from racism, from unemployment, from war, from poverty and inequality.</P>
<P>British socialist Duncan Hallas came to the U.S. to give a national tour of meetings about Karl Marx in honor of the 100th anniversary of Marx's death&#150;and wrote this article for <I>Socialist Worker. </I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="../../2002-2/423/423_08_HallasOnMarx.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Don't Buy "Buy American"</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>Support for import plans is not difficult to explain. When American industry faces a crisis, the solution seems easy and straightforward&#150;stop the imports and American workers will be put back to work.</P>
<P>The problem, however, is that protectionism doesn't work&#150;import controls do not create jobs. Moreover, they are reactionary and utopian. They divert the anger and frustration of workers in each country from those actually responsible for the crisis&#150;the bosses and their system.</P>
<P>As the early 1980s recession hammered U.S. workers, Japan-bashing and support for tough trade barriers to curb imported products&#150;policies known as "protectionism"&#150;took hold in the labor movement. <I>SW </I>published this article challenging the assumptions of the protectionists. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="500S_198306_Protection.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>On April 4, when an anti-apartheid rally at Columbia University turned into a blockade of the main undergraduate classroom and administration building, no one expected it to last more than 24 hours. But it did last longer&#150;much longer&#150;and became a major headache for the university and a source of inspiration for other protests across the country. Students who never questioned the way the system is run became more aware of the endless brutalities of capitalism&#150;and of how they must be ended. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>The 1,500 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) Local P-9 braved the combined assault of a determined company, the National Guard, the courts, the press&#150;and their own International union. </P>
<P>The strike of meatpackers against the George A. Hormel Co. in Austin, Minn., became one of the most important battles for labor during the 1980s.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Deal, Jesse, Deal</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>Many on the left who supported the Jesse Jackson campaign did so because they believed the "progressive movement" behind the Black candidate would break the stranglehold of conservatism on U.S. politics. But with the 1988 party convention approaching, Jackson dropped the remnants of his "radical" rhetoric and capitulated to the policies of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for the sake of "party unity" and a role in a future Democratic administration.</P>
<P>Far from reviving the independent left, the Jackson campaign instead reinforced the idea that the Democratic Party&#150;a patsy of big business and the enemy of the workers everywhere&#150;is the only political option for militants interested in changing society. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="500S_198807_Jesse.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>When the Nicaraguan revolution toppled the Somoza dynasty in 1979, everything seemed possible. For the first time since the Cuban revolution 20 years earlier, a movement in the Americas triumphed against a Washington-backed dictatorship. It seemed the beginning of a chain which would see U.S. client states fall in Guatemala and El Salvador.</P>
<P>Ten years later, however, the Nicaraguan economy was near collapse. Nicaragua's $550 per capita income ranked at the bottom of the Western Hemisphere, just above Haiti's. The 1987 Esquipulas peace process had forced Nicaragua to accept a number of humiliating concessions to the West and the domestic right-wing opposition, and the ARENA government's triumph in El Salvador was testament to the failure of the Central American revolution to spread beyond Nicaragua's borders.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>The Lawrence textile strike of 1912 demonstrated all the strengths and weakness of the IWW. Here, the organization proved it was possible to organize immigrant textile workers of 25 different nationalities who spoke 45 different languages. </P>
<P>Mass meetings to keep morale and organization high were held in all languages, and mass picketing was sustained throughout the strike. It was possible on some days to see 20,000 workers weaving their way through the streets of Lawrence in a "moving" picket that covered every struck mill. Despite the presence of 2,500 soldiers and virtual state of martial law in the city, the strike was victorious. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>A revolution begins</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>There are moments in history when whole populations suddenly turn against corrupt and despotic regimes. Hope replaces despair. The streets are filled with ecstatic crowds, smiling, cheering, embracing each other, as an exultant solidarity breaks down old social barriers and dissolves old enmities. The defenders of hierarchy and the apostles of order are thrown completely onto the defensive, unable to rely any longer even on the riot shields and machine guns of their hired thugs.</P>
<P>So it was in the summer and autumn of 1989 across Eastern Europe. But the first flush of revolution was not just a time of great hopes and great accomplishments. It was also a time of great illusions&#150;as the Western media gave the impression that "freedom" had dawned in Eastern Europe, based on parliamentary elections and unrestrained free market forces. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="500S_199001_EEurope.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

<P>Another aspect, which was apparent to anyone looking at the images, but which never until the last moment did the news commentators grasp was that from the beginning of the looting, this turned into a kind of postmodern equivalent to traditional bread riots&#150;an uprising of the poor. In many places, it was totally good-humored, indeed, almost like a carnival. People looted sometimes for luxury goods, but on the whole were just looting necessities of life. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="500S_199205_LARebellion.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

OR had promised four weeks of blockades of Buffalo clinics on the scale of their August 1991 attack on Wichita, Kan. Unlike Wichita, in Buffalo, OR was met from day one by angry pro-choice crowds chanting, "You're not in Kansas anymore, we'll defend the clinic door!" </P>

Staley, Caterpillar and Bridgestone-Firestone. Even though they were defeated, the "War Zone" struggles helped to breathe sorely needed life into the tradition of solidarity in the labor movement.

The right has succeeded in popularizing the idea that anyone who challenges sexism is "too sensitive." This goes hand in hand with the argument that the women's movement actually went "too far"&#150;and ended up hurting men.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>"They shot him down like a dog."

Outstanding traffic violations, the cops said. But his real crime was to be Black.</P>
<P>The bottled-up anger at one police murder after another in Cincinnati finally began to bubble over.

Bush and his government were beating the drum for even more death and destruction.

<P>But the biggest problem for Sharon is that Palestinians still believe in the Intifada&#150;and that resistance is the way to ending Israel's occupation and achieving Palestinian rights to a state, the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their land and the right to be free of colonialism. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="990000"><b>| <a href="../../2002-1/401/401_06_TouficHaddad.shtml">Read the full article</a></b></font></P>

<P>The CHA was prepared to tear down all of the city's traditional high-rise housing projects and replace them with "mixed-income" developments.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>The great Sioux leader Sitting Bull, a chief among a people who subsisted by hunting buffalo and who also knew no class divisions, had a dim view of the economic and social system brought by Europe to America.

"They take tithes from the poor and weak to support the rich who rule."</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>Mass movements do not spring up overnight. Most people know that in 1955 Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man, sparking the Montgomery bus boycott that drew in tens of thousands of Black activists&#150;and launching the mass civil rights movement that finally brought down legal segregation. But Parks was also thrown off a bus 11 years earlier&#150;after refusing to enter through the back door&#150;with no more than a ripple of protest.</P>

My friend James said it felt something like the end of apartheid, or the Berlin Wall coming down."</P>
