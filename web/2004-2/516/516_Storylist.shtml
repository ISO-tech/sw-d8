<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_01_GetOut.shtml">We say: Get out of Iraq now!</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It's official...again. The Bush administration lied about weapons of mass destruction to get its war on Iraq. But "democracy and freedom" for Iraqis--that was the biggest lie of them all.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Attack on pensions</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_12_Pensions.shtml">Corporate America is trying to steal our future</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The corporate vultures who grabbed pension funds for profits in the 1990s are out to slash those retirement funds today--or abandon their obligations altogether.<p>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b><i>SW</i> SPECIAL FEATURES</b></font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Why Iraq isn't a "diversion" from the "real war"</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_06_BipartisanWar.shtml">The bipartisan war on the world</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">John Kerry claims that Bush's obsession with Iraq took attention away from the "war on terror." And tragically, some antiwar leaders are echoing this prowar argument.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_05_MilitaryOut.shtml">Get the military out of our schools</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">City officials want to open a "naval academy" in a Chicago high school--and increase the already strong influence of the armed forces in our schools.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>An argument to scare progressives into voting Democrat</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_08_SupremeCourt.shtml">What about the Supreme Court?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Democrats are recycling an argument about the future of the Supreme Court that progressives can set their watches by--because we hear it every four years.<p>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>WHAT WE THINK</b></font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Behind Bush and Kerry's narrow debate...</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_03_FakeChoice.shtml">A fake choice</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like everything about Election 2004, the presidential debates are designed to highlight the candidates' limited disagreements--while hiding much larger areas of basic agreement.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_03_Israel.shtml">Israel buries the "peace" process</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The suicide bombing that targeted Israeli tourists in Egypt captured front-page headlines, but the more lethal Israeli violence against Palestinians both before and after the bombing was barely mentioned.<p>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>INTERNATIONAL NEWS</b></font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Freedom is beautiful," George Bush said as elections were held in the country he conquered. Ordinary Afghanis would use different words to describe the "vote"--like "fraud."<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Israel escalates the terror</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_06_Israel.shtml">Washington's favored ally in the Middle East</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">U.S. officials see Israel's occupation of Palestine as another front in the U.S. "war on terror." This means backing Israel's state-sponsored terror to the hilt.<p>


<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>NATIONAL NEWS</b></font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Chicago transit chief threatens service cuts and layoffs</b></font><br>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Proposed budget at the Chicago Transit Authority would slash bus and train service that low-income workers depend on--and kick more than 1,000 CTA workers out of a job.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Supply is far short of need</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="516_02_FluVaccine.shtml">Behind the flu vaccine scandal</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The announcement of a huge shortage of flu vaccine is another facet of an already existing disaster, known as the for-profit U.S. health care system.<p>
