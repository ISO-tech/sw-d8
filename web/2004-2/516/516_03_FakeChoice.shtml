<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"THESE FIRST three debates," New York's <i>Newsday </i>declared in an editorial, "have been scintillating and revelatory. Nobody who has listened can come away saying there is no difference between the candidates."<p>
In St. Louis, a "town hall" meeting with a carefully selected audience, almost all of them white, asking pre-screened questions--that's scintillating? Two candidates who spend days being drilled by their handlers and advisers about how to squeeze their standard, non-committal sound bites into the form of answers--that's revelatory?<p>
Conservative columnist George Will gave the more honest view: "Presidential debates are to real debates as processed cheese is to cheese. They are preceded by elaborate negotiations to prevent the unseemly outbreak of anything debate-like, such as a sustained development, and critique, of arguments."<p>
Like everything about Election 2004, the debates between the Democratic and Republican presidential tickets have been designed to highlight the candidates' limited disagreements--while hiding the much larger areas of basic agreement on fundamental questions.<p>
Take the U.S. occupation of Iraq. Once you cut through Kerry's narrow criticisms of <i>how </i>the Bush administration carried out its war on Iraqis--and Bush's whining complaints about Kerry's "flip-flopping"--the two candidates have almost identical answers to the question of what happens next: keep U.S. soldiers on the ground, get other countries (somehow) to contribute forces for the occupation, make sure a pliant Iraqi government is installed, and, above all, crush all resistance, wherever it emerges.<p>
When the questions turned to domestic policy at the St. Louis "town hall" debate, Kerry emphasized his record of support for conservative policies first championed by Republicans--the vicious welfare "reform" law passed under Bill Clinton, law-and-order legislation that put more cops on the street, balancing the federal government budget by slashing programs that benefit working people. <p>
Even on an issue where there is a difference between the candidates--a women's right to abortion--Kerry scrambled to put the matter in the conservative terms that have given up ground to the anti-abortion fanatics over a period of decades. And that's not to mention the range of issues--from full-throated support for Israel's apartheid, to opposition to gay marriage--where the two candidates agree.<p>
What this illustrates is how far the two mainstream parties have together traveled to the right--a far greater distance than the differences, when they exist at all, between Bush and Kerry today. <p>
And this, in turn, shows the truth about the two-party system. It isn't designed to offer a real choice, or even a real discussion about important issues. The Republicans and Democrats exist as two wings of a single political establishment--and define the outside limits of debate to a narrow political spectrum that doesn't contain anything which might threaten the system as a whole. Both parties are fueled by corporate cash--which gives the tiny minority of rulers veto power over what happens in Washington. They offer a "choice" on Election Day--but it is a fake choice.<p>
Millions of people are looking at Election 2004--with a sense of urgency about the need to get rid of George Bush. That's understandable. Everyone who stands for justice and democracy wants to see the end of Bush's reign.<p>
But John Kerry is proving with every debate appearance and every campaign speech that you can succeed in getting rid of Bush, but fail to get rid of <i>Bushism--</i>that the Bush agenda pursued relentlessly over the past four years can remain in place, with John Kerry and the Democrats running the show.<p>
That's because the "Bush agenda" doesn't belong uniquely to the Republicans and the neoconservative hawks who inhabit the White House. It represents a program--for expanding U.S. power abroad, and defending the wealth and privileges of corporations and the ruling elite at home--that both parties of the Washington establishment are firmly committed to, even if they disagree at times over how to implement it.<p>
What we need isn't the least bad of these two rotten choices, but an alternative to the two-party duopoly. And you <i>can </i>show your support for that alternative in Election 2004--by supporting the independent campaign of Ralph Nader and Peter Camejo. Nader and Camejo oppose the U.S. occupation of Iraq; support union rights and the government programs that both Republicans and Democrats want to cut back; and represent a left-wing challenge to the political stranglehold of the two corporate parties.<p>
Nader is far from a perfect candidate. He was wrong to accept the endorsement of the right-wing Reform Party--and now the ballot line of the Independence Party in New York. This undercuts his campaign's stand for progressive politics--and the efforts of all the activists who worked so hard to get Nader on the ballot and to challenge the slanders against him from the Anybody But Bush liberals.<p>
Still, Nader and Camejo represent a genuine alternative to politics as usual--and one that hasn't compromised in challenging the two corporate parties. They deserve your support.<p>
