<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THE U.S. Supreme Court last week gave police a green light to demand answers from potential defendants--even before they've been informed of their Constitutional rights. In 1997, police shot Oliverio Martinez--an Oxnard, Calif., farmworker--five times in the face, legs and back.</P>
<P>As he lay gravely wounded in a hospital bed, a police sergeant proceeded to interrogate him, despite his cries of pain and pleas to be left alone. But according to a 6-to-3 Supreme Court ruling, the failure of police to inform Martinez of his "Miranda" rights wasn't a constitutional violation--since he was never forced to testify against himself in court.</P>
<P>"I'm choking," Martinez told the interrogating officer. "I'm dying, please."</P>
<P>"If you're going to die," snapped the officer, "tell me what happened."</P>
<P>The shooting left Martinez blind and paralyzed, but he was never charged with a crime. Writing for the three-judge minority, Justice John Paul Stevens characterized the interrogation as "an attempt to obtain an involuntary confession from a prisoner by torturous methods."</P>
<P>But Clarence Thomas--one of the court's right-wing zealots--was more concerned with the "success of the investigation" than the possibility of torture. He said that a coercive interrogation was justified by the "urgent" circumstances. After all, according to Thomas, there was a "risk that key evidence would have been lost if Martinez had died without the authorities ever hearing his side of the story."</P>
<P>In court, the Oxnard police department based its defense on the claim that suspects don't have a "constitutional right to be free of coercive interrogation," only the right not to have such a confession used at trial.</P>
<P>Predictably, the Bush administration filed a brief expressing its support for the police. And a majority of the justices backed up the cops' "interpretation" of Miranda rights. This ruling represents another step in chipping away of our civil liberties.</P>
