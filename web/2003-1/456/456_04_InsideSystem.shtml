<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"IF SOME tinhorn terrorist wants me, tell him to come and get me! I'll be at home! Waiting for the bastard!" Was this Dubya talking tough on September 11? Nope. It's a scene from a Toronto sound stage. </P>
<P>The hammy dialogue was recently filmed for The Big Dance, a two-hour television movie to be broadcast this September. The movie is being promoted as the all-but-official White House account of the "war on terror." It's easy to see why. A copy of the script shows that the main character is a nearly infallible, heroic president, a tendency for giving articulate, off-the-cuff speeches. </P>
<P>Lionel Chetwynd, the film's creator, is a Hollywood Republican and White House insider. "My own view of the administration is somewhat more sympathetic than, say, Alec Baldwin's," said Chetwynd. </P>
<P>According to reports, Chetwynd's script is based on lengthy interviews with Bush, Rove, White House aide Andrew Card, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other Republican officials in the White House and the Pentagon. He claims that every scene and line of dialogue was described to him by an insider or taken from "credible" reports. </P>
<P>But in the movie, Bush delivers long, stirring speeches that immediately become policy. "We start with [al-Qaeda terror chief Osama] bin Laden," says Dubya, the character. "That's what the American people will expect. Getting him will be a huge blow for our side. So let's build a coalition for that job. Later, we can shape different coalitions for different tasks."</P>
<P>At one point, arguing with Democratic Party officials about the war, he delivers the line: "I won't be seeking a declaration of war. With a shadowy enemy, specificity makes that problematic." This from the same man who's known for saying, "Is our children learning?"</P>
