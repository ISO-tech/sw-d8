<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>PENTAGON OFFICIALS announced earlier this month that there are no plans to remove the leftover debris from depleted uranium (DU) weapons used in Iraq.</P>
<P>The Pentagon prizes munitions coated with DU, a uranium-enriched metal, because they pierce the hulls of tanks and other metal objects. But when the weapons explode, they release a toxic cloud of radioactive gas and dust.</P>
<P>During the first Gulf War in 1991, U.S.-led forces used 320 tons of DU munitions on Iraq. This was apparently responsible for a horrific spike in cancer rates in Iraq--and is thought to be a contributing factor to Gulf War Syndrome that affects tens of thousands of U.S. veterans. But Col. James Naughton of the Army Materiel Command said at a Pentagon briefing earlier this year that DU gives the U.S. an "edge," and "we don't want to give that up."</P>
<P>This month, the Pentagon claimed that no cleanup would be necessary--because their "new" studies show that DU is harmless. The brass must have missed a recent United Nations report that found radioactive debris from DU weapons still present in the air and groundwater in Bosnia-Herzegovina--more than seven years after they were used.</P>
