<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Half a million people across the U.S. sent George W. Bush an unmistakable message on January 18: We don't want your war on Iraq. And we're ready to take a stand to stop you.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The Bush gang calls for an end to affirmative action</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="437_12_AffirmativeAction.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>This is an attack on civil rights</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bush took the opportunity of Rev. Martin Luther King's birthday to show his support for overturning affirmative action at the University of Michigan--and quite possibly the entire country.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">January 22 marked the 30th anniversary of the legalization of abortion in the U.S. Now, the attack on abortion rights tops the agenda of Bush and his henchmen in Congress.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In a world turned upside down, Venezuela has experienced an odd type of "general strike" since December 2. It isn't led by workers demanding higher wages, health benefits or political advances. The strike is a lockout led by bosses.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">With close to 150,000 U.S. troops deployed, the Bush White House has made it clear that it's ready for an all-out assault on Iraq--and it will use all the means at its disposal, including more "discoveries" of Iraqi weaponry, to get its war.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">More than 100,000 people are expected at the third annual World Social Forum this week in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Class warfare?" queried <I>Business Week</I> recently--as if the question needs asking in Bush's America. "Suppose the rich get richer and income inequality gets worse," the article mused--its unspoken question: "Can we still get away with it?"</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Most history books treat historical change as the accomplishment of great men (and an occasional woman). The opposite, though less popular, view is that history follows a path which no individual can influence. Both ideas are mistaken.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Impending indictments. A 47-page FBI affidavit. An independent audit revealing $5 million stolen by executive officers.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The media were quick to latch on to the good-versus-evil theme in the movie <I>The Two Towers</I>, as a profound metaphor for the "war on terrorism." But <I>The Two Towers</I> delivers a very different message.</P>
