<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Bush's war budget scam</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>By Eric Ruder</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> | April 18, 2003 | Page 2</font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>LAST WEEKEND, Congress passed a $79 billion package to fund Bush's invasion of Iraq--and decided to help itself in the process. Tucked inside the massive spending bill were provisions to fund pet projects of individual senators and corporate welfare for well-connected executives.</P>
<P>Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), for example, managed to slip in a provision to renovate an agricultural research center in his home state--at a cost of $110 million.</P>
<P>But airline executives were the big winners, raking in a $3.5 billion bailout. Laid-off airline workers will get 26 extra weeks of unemployment insurance, but this amounts to less than 20 percent of the total package.</P>
<P>The lion's share of the money will be cash grants--no strings attached--to the biggest airlines. And this bailout comes on top of $15 billion that the airlines received just after the September 11 attacks.</P>
<P>The legislation exposes Washington's real priorities. Of the $72.5 billion directly related to the war, $2.5 billion--a total of 3.4 percent--will go toward reconstruction. And even though desperate hunger stalks Iraq's cities, a mere $369 million--or 0.5 percent--will go for food aid.</P>
<P>The rest of the money will pay for new munitions, troop deployments, the call-up of reserves--and buying the support of countries in the so-called "coalition of the willing."</P>
<P>Bush also asked Congress to give him total authority over how the administration uses the money--a request that Congress refused to grant. "Not since Richard Nixon's administration has a White House been more aggressive in asserting executive control over of the power of the purse," wrote the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.</P>
