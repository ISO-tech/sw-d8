<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bush and his pack of mad-dog Republicans are off the leash--and they're attacking everything in their path, from civil liberties to union rights. But they have billions to burn on the Pentagon war machine and a planned slaughter in Iraq.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>Socialist Worker </I>looks at two motivations behind the Bush administration's desire for war with Iraq--the thirst for oil profits and Washington's drive to expand its power.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Why discrimination remains at the heart of U.S. society</b></font><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Racism returned to the center stage of American politics over the last couple of months. Unfortunately, though, the debate that followed has done little to explain what racism actually is and what can be done about it.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Do they even care whether we believe this stuff? In the week after the State of the Union address, the Bush gang was spouting a whole pack of lies--both new fibs and recycled whoppers--to back up their case for a war on Iraq.</P>

<P><A HREF="439_03_SpaceProgram.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>The space program's real mission</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Was the drive for corporate profits behind the Columbia space shuttle disaster? With the media's coverage echoing Bush's themes of patriotism and sacrifice, few mainstream voices were asking that question--but they should have.</P>
