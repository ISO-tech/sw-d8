<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>FRONT AND BACK PAGES</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>We're telling George Bush</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="436_01_NoBlood4Oil.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>No more blood for oil</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"No smoking gun." Last week's announcement from UN chief weapons inspector Hans Blix couldn't have been much clearer. But don't think this will stop the White House from trying to launch its war.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>VICTORY!</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="436_16_DeathPenalty.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Death row shut down in Illinois</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Declaring that the death penalty system was "haunted by the demon of error," Illinois Gov. George Ryan made history last weekend when he emptied death row. He commuted the sentences of all 156 death row prisoners--a decision almost unparalleled in the history of America's killing machine.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Voices of the antiwar opposition</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="436_08_AntiwarVoices.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>We say no to Bush's war</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>Socialist Worker</I> talks to longtime activists and left-wing writers--including John Pilger, Norman Soloman, Rania Masri and others--about the issues and questions we face in making the case against Bush's war.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Don't buy the criticisms of the ''anti-antiwar'' crusaders</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="436_03_AntiAntiWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Antiwar with no apologies</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The movement against a new war on Iraq has grown more quickly than previous antiwar struggles. But the corporate media regularly devotes more space to critics who question not the war, but the motives and tactics of antiwar activists.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The "opposition" that Bush backs</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="436_07_IraqOpposition.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Thugs, crooks and con men</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Bush claims that the U.S. is going to war in Iraq "to liberate, not to conquer." But a quick look at the shadowy cast of characters the White House wants to help carry out "regime change" shows what kind of "liberation" it has in mind.</P>

<P><A HREF="436_07_Blix.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>How UN inspectors became Washington's tools</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many who oppose Bush's war drive against Iraq believe that UN weapons inspectors are "independent" of the U.S. But the opposite is true--and the record of chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix shows why.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Federal government witch-hunt against Arabs and Muslims</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="436_06_Detentions.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Victims of the war at home</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The new rule requiring certain immigrant men to register with the federal government is supposed to make the U.S. "safer," while "protecting the rights of individuals coming here," John Ashcroft says. He should ask Bijan Pirazdeh if he feels "safe" or "protected."</P>

<P><A HREF="436_06_CivilRights.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Ashcroft's war on our civil liberties</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">According to John Ashcroft, "freedom requires vigilance and security if it is to flourish." Since September 11, he's been very "vigilant"--about systematically attacking our rights.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The West's long record of betrayal</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="436_10_Kurds.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Will a U.S. war free the Kurds?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We're regularly reminded that Saddam Hussein gassed and killed thousands of Iraqi Kurds in the village of Halabja in 1988. But Washington and the West have a long record of betraying the Kurdish people.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The socialist alternative to a system of violence and poverty</b></font><BR>
<A HREF="436_11_WorldWithoutWar.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>A world without war</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The historian Eric Hobsbawm calculates that 187 million people have died from wars in the last century. Given this grim picture, it's tempting to view war as something that is inherent in human nature. But it isn't.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Bush gang is carrying out the domestic equivalent of the "Bush Doctrine" internationally--taking the offensive on many fronts at once, with the goal of establishing power and intimidating the opposition.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Just days after proposing "a plan that will help people find work," Bush left 1 million jobless workers without any unemployment benefits--even as the terrible job market gets worse.</P>

The proposal would require all U.S. citizens and permanent residents aged 18 to 26 to complete two years of compulsory service, inside or outside the armed forces.</P>

<P><A HREF="436_02_Pickering.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Bush's anti-abortion attack</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Charles Pickering, the Mississippi judge known for his racist views and anti-abortion fanaticism, is once again being put forward by the Bush administration to be a federal appeals court judge.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Just as the Bush administration started to back out of its confrontation with North Korea, the government of Kim Jong-il turned up the heat January 10 by announcing its withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>ISRAEL/PALESTINE</b></font><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Just a few weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his right-wing Likud Party looked set to win the upcoming January 28 elections. But Sharon has been engulfed by a string of scandals, and he's now in a fight for his political life.</P>
