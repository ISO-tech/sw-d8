<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>IF YOU thought that John Ashcroft's Justice Department couldn't sink any lower, guess again.</P>
<P>First, the Feds made sure that 17-year-old sniper suspect John Lee Malvo would be tried in Virginia--because that state has the death penalty for juveniles. Now, according to the <I>Seattle Times,</I> a judge from the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review has ordered Malvo's mother, Una James, to be deported.</P>
<P>Officials now claim that she bought false immigration papers in order to enter the U.S. in 2000. In December of 2001, when James asked police for help after her son had run away, police arrested both her and Malvo--claiming that the two were in the U.S. illegally.</P>
<P>Now, James is set to be booted--unless authorities decide they need her as a "material witness" at her son's trial.</P>
