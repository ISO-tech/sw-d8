<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>JOE STRUMMER, lead singer of legendary punk band The Clash, died of a heart attack on December 22 at the age of 50. The Clash, formed in 1976, earned the title "the only band that matters," from <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazine.</P>
<P>With a voice full of gravel and fury, and playing his guitar so frantically that he had to tape his wrist so it wouldn't be cut on his guitar strings, Strummer became a driving force behind the band's musical and political development.</P>
<P>Strummer's lyrics blended well with guitarist Mick Jones' arrangements, and he steered the band toward a more overtly political message--as when he convinced Jones to change the song "I'm So Bored With You" (about Jones' girlfriend) to "I'm So Bored With the USA," a scorching rant against U.S. imperialism and arrogance.</P>
<P>"Joe was the political engine of the band," socialist punk rocker Billy Bragg told the British <I>Guardian</I> newspaper, "and without Joe there's no political Clash, and without The Clash the whole political edge of punk would have been severely dulled." </P>
<P>At its best, Strummer's political edge is showcased in songs like "White Riot," a celebration of a Black riot against police brutality, and "(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais," about music taking a political stand. "We were trying to grope in a socialist way towards some future where the world might be less of a miserable place than it is," Joe commented in the 1999 documentary <I>Westway to the World</I>.</P>
<P>He returned to recording in 1999 with his new band, the Mescaleros. Though less overtly political, both Mescaleros albums are well-crafted musically and contain left-wing politics--in songs such as "Shaktar Donesk" a plea for immigrant rights. Fittingly, one of Strummer's last performances came when he reunited with Jones in November 2002 at a benefit for British firefighters preparing to strike.</P>
<P>Strummer's influence can be felt in so many bands that followed, including the Dead Kennedys, Rancid, Anti-Flag and the Manic Street Preachers. In 1976, talking about the need for a left-wing voice in punk, Strummer told the fanzine <I>Sniffin' Glue</I>: "Look, the situation is far too serious for enjoyment, man. Maybe when we're 55 we can play tubas in the sun. That's alright then to enjoy yourselves&#133;but now?"</P>
<P>Strummer never got the chance to play a "tuba in the sun"--but somehow, I don't think he would've wanted to.</P>
