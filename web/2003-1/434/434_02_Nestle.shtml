<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>THE MANAGERS of multinational food giant Nestl&eacute; didn't get where they are today by letting money slip through their fingers. Even if they have to extort it from starving Ethiopians.</P>
<P>Nestl&eacute; is the largest food company in the world. And Ethiopia is the world's poorest country, where food shortages threaten to grow worse in the coming months than the famine that killed 1 million people in 1984.</P>
<P>Yet last month, Nestl&eacute; demanded that the Ethiopian government reimburse it for $6 million that it says its German subsidiary lost when the military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Miriam took control of foreign-owned industries in the 1970s.</P>
<P>The $6 million amounts to a few hours' worth of revenue for Nestl&eacute;. But in Ethiopia--where per capita income is just $100 a year--the money could buy food for a month for more than 1 million people.</P>
<P>Nestl&eacute;'s recent attempt to squeeze money out of a poor country isn't new. Over the last few decades, the company has spent millions of dollars promoting its dried milk products as a substitute for mothers' breast milk, despite the fact that it is a poor--and potentially deadly--replacement.</P>
<P>Milk substitutes like the one Nestl&eacute; peddles require water to make them. And because water quality is typically bad in these countries, the risk of contaminating babies with water-borne diseases is great. The aid agency UNICEF estimates that 1.5 million babies a year die from unsafe bottle-feeding. Yet Nestl&eacute; continues to aggressively market its dried milk products.</P>
<P>Public outcry over its latest attempt to rob a poor country forced Nestl&eacute; to promise last week that it would reinvest the $6 million in famine relief. But the fact is that it's not Ethiopians who owe Nestl&eacute;. It's the other way around.</P>
