<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The anti-immigrant politics of the Ron Paul campaign align it with Bush's "war on terror" and the Minuteman-like hate groups.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Congressional Democrats are still claiming they "don't have the votes" to challenge the Bush White House--even though they're the majority party in Congress.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">How can the antiwar movement reach out to wider layers of people who oppose the war, but are not yet active, and give them confidence to get involved?<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-2/649/649_03_TooLate.shtml">Too late and too little</a></b></font><br>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The idea that antiwar protests don't matter has spread far--echoed even by people in, or sympathetic to, the antiwar movement. The conclusion, however, is mistaken.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-2/638/638_09_Obama.shtml">Does Obama stand for a different foreign policy?</a></b></font><br>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It is important that the antiwar movement reject the distorted picture of Islam presented by pro-war conservatives, and oppose the entire project of the "war on terror."<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While Rep. Charles Rangel may raise the right questions about who the U.S. government sends into battle, his plan to bring back the draft is terribly wrong.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Why has UFPJ been so timid in calling protests?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/603/603_11_Antiwar.shtml">The antiwar struggle and the Democrats</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">By every conceivable measure, the antiwar movement in the United States should be a vibrant, mass movement. So why is it so passive?<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The central demand of the "Global Day for Darfur" was not an appeal for stepped-up aid to the victims, but a call for 20,000 NATO/UN troops to occupy the region.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Opinion polls show that opposition to George Bush's war for oil and empire is wider than ever. Yet within the antiwar movement, some voices say they support <i>continued </i>occupation.<p>
