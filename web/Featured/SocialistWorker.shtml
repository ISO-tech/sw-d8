<a name="Goals"></a><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>OUR GOALS FOR <i>SOCIALIST WORKER</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-2/475/475_08_SW.shtml">Why we sell <I>Socialist Worker</I></a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The revolutionary newspaper is a central weapon in the arsenal of those fighting for a better world.</P>

<P><A HREF="../2002-1/408/408_08_SWAsOrganizer.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>A tool for organizing</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>SW</I> digs beneath the surface of important stories and exposes the lies that the politicians and their media helpers tell us. But <I>Socialist Worker</I> aims to do more. For a revolutionary socialist who is building an organization, a newspaper like <I>SW</I> is also a central organizing tool.</P>

<P><A HREF="../2002-1/402/402_06_SWAgitator.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Agitator and organizer</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Producing a socialist newspaper is about more than telling the truth. We want to convince readers not only about what's wrong with the world--but that they need to act to change it.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>From the editor of <I>Socialist Worker</I></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="Stories/SW_EditorsFeature.shtml">A voice for our side</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When <I>Socialist Worker</I> announced our plan to begin publishing weekly in October, we said that the pace of political events was developing rapidly, faster than a biweekly newspaper could keep up with. Little did we know.</P>

<a name="Movement"></a><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>NEWSPAPERS OF THE MOVEMENT</b></font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="Stories/SW_Voice.shtml">"A movement has to control its own voice"</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Dan Georgakas, co-author of the book <I>Detroit: I Do Mind Dying,</I> talks about the vital role that newspapers played during the organizing of the 1960s Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Building the struggle against slavery</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="Stories/SW_Abolitionists.shtml">The abolitionists and their papers</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The terrible crime of slavery in the U.S. South is at least taught in high school history classes. But the struggle to end slavery--launched decades before the Civil War began--gets little attention.</P>

<a name="Marxism"></a><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>MARXISM AND THE REVOLUTIONARY NEWSPAPER</b></font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="Stories/SW_SocialistNewspaper.shtml">A socialist newspaper to fight for our side</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The role of the mainstream press, to quote Karl Marx, is to reflect "the ruling ideas of society." <I>New York Times</I> journalist John Swinton put it more colorfully at his retirement party. </P>
