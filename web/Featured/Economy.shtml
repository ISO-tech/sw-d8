<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Federal Reserve Bank's decision to cut interest rates in mid-September proves that the threat of a recession accelerated by the bursting of the housing bubble is very real.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Alan Greenspan's real accomplishments as the country's most important financial official are much different than the media praise he received when he stepped down.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-1/539/539_06_EndofOil.shtml">The end of oil?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Underlying the recent surge in gas prices is a more serious long-term issue: rising demand for oil internationally, as production reaches its peak.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-1/492/492_08_Offshore.shtml">What's to blame for lost jobs?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Corporate outsourcing and offshoring of jobs has become a central question in the 2004 presidential elections, but the debate has only scratched the surface of the real reasons for job losses.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-2/477/477_13_SteelPolitics.shtml">Steel and the politics of "free" trade</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Is American steel a rust-belt relic or a pillar of the U.S. economy? This question came to the fore after the World Trade Organization announced that the U.S. had violated WTO rules by placing tariffs on imported steel.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-1/455/455_06_Economy.shtml">What's behind the fears of deflation?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. government's top financial officials sent shock waves through Wall Street when they admitted that the U.S. economy was at risk of deflation--the very thing that tore the bottom out of the economic system during the 1930s.</P>
