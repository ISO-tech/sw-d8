<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One of the most horrific war crimes of the 20th century took place 20 years ago this week--the slaughter of defenseless Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Shatila camps in Lebanon during Israel's 1982 invasion.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-1/407/407_06_IsraelsTerror.shtml">Israel's long and bloody record of war crimes</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What Israel has carried out in its war against Palestinians invites comparison to some of the worst atrocities of the 20th century--a comparison that at least some Israelis are making themselves.</P>

<P><A HREF="../2002-1/400/400_07_Arafat.shtml"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Why did Arafat agree to an unjust peace?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For decades, the Palestinian struggle for national liberation inspired people committed to global justice--and Yasser Arafat was considered that struggle's determined leader. But today, he seems a shadow of his former self. How did it come to this?</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Should the antiwar movement take up the question of Palestine? Or, to put it another way, can the movement oppose one element of U.S. domination of the Middle East, the occupation of Iraq, while ignoring the other--the U.S.-funded Israeli occupation of Palestine?</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The only just solution is a democratic and secular Palestine, with equal rights for all. Achieving this will mean confronting Israel; its backer, U.S. imperialism; and the corrupt and dictatorial Arab states that collaborate with the U.S.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To the U.S. and Israel, all Palestinians who fight back against repression are mindless "terrorists." But this is a slander against a national liberation movement with a long history of struggle.</P>
