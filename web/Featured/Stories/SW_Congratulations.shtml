<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Congratulations from <i>SW</i> readers</b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>WE APPLAUD your unparalleled courage and integrity! The truth has a voice ONLY because of <I>Socialist Worker</I>. Every major newspaper in this country, including the <I>Times,</I> wrote of the Michael Pardue case. Of all these publications, only one had the backbone to expose the nature of the beast called the Alabama justice system. Only <I>SW </I>dared to tell the shocking truth of the incomprehensible injustice in our case. We thank you and congratulate you in your growth!<BR>
--<B>Michael and Becky Pardue</b><br>
<i>Michael was wrongfully imprisoned in Alabama for 27 years. He was released earlier this year.</I></P>
<P>IN A time of government and corporate media hysteria, it's all the more important to have a sane voice of reason that can stand up to the powers that be with critical consciousness. That's what <I>Socialist Worker</I> has been doing for years. Now going to a weekly format, it stands up even taller and meets the historic challenge.<BR>
--<B>Kevin Danaher,</B> cofounder of Global Exchange and author of <I>Globalize This!</P></I>
<P>THE NEED is great for a variety of independent media to directly challenge the dominance of corporate priorities. Despite the claims of the mainstream press, there are viable democratic alternatives to privatization, economic injustice, environmental degradation and war. We need much wider public debate--and an upsurge of activism for social justice and peace. <I>Socialist Worker</I> is helping to move such debate and activism forward by providing a forum for outlooks and information that rarely get into the mass media.<BR>
--<B>Norman Solomon,</B> syndicated columnist on media and politics</P>
<P>I'M A political prisoner in the state of Illinois, and where I'm at, there is no TV nor a newspaper that covers worldly events like <I>Socialist Worker</I>. <I>Socialist Worker</I> has become my eyes and ears to this worldly knowledge. I must say, to be in a place like this and not receive the <I>SW</I>, I'd still be thinking in a primitive state of mind. I'd really like to thank <I>Socialist Worker</I> for its stand against the racist death penalty, which is my personal favorite as an issue. Thank you, <I>Socialist Worker</I>, for your excellent journalism and layout.<BR>
--<B>Ronald Kitchen,</B> Illinois death row prisoner</P>
<P>I WOULD like to give applause to the staff at <I>Socialist Worker</I> for the magnificent job that they do. The broad spectrum of domestic and international news that they cover regularly helps to increase the knowledge of any reader who may be unaware of world events. I'm grateful for the recent decision to supply readers with a weekly version. Thank God for a newspaper that is open, honest and consistent in truth. Keep up the good work!<BR>
--<B>Alma Clark-Chalmers,</B> member of AFSCME District Council 37, Local 371</P>
<P>CONGRATULATIONS TO <I>Socialist Worker</I> on becoming a weekly publication!
In today's America, most cities have only one major newspaper, and nearly all of the country's news sources are owned by a handful of individuals.
In times of crises such as these, the need for alternative news sources like the <I>Socialist Worker</I> is especially important.
Many thanks for offering those on the Left a real choice in where to receive their news.<BR>
--<B>Daniella Dwyer-Grove, </B>Campaign to End the Death Penalty, Chicago-Hyde Park chapter</P>
<P>SINCE 1982, I have learned a great deal from the ISO, and I look forward to your doubling the coverage!<BR>
--<B>Patrick Bond, </B>South African journalist and author of the forthcoming book <I>Against Global Apartheid: South Africa Meets the World Bank, IMF and International Finance</P></I>
<P>AS A prison inmate, I see my fellow prisoners being immersed in corporate propaganda from the mainstream media on a daily basis. I use the articles in <I>Socialist Worker</I> to give prisoners an alternative perspective. Many are quite surprised to see a newspaper that advances the interests of the downtrodden. They've never been exposed to anything like it. The more <I>Socialist Worker</I>, the better.<BR>
--<B>Adrian Lomax,</B> prisoner in the Oregon Correctional Facility in Wisconsin and contributor to the book <I>The Celling of America</P></I>
<P>I THINK that <I>Socialist Worker</I> is a great help, and will be more so as a weekly, for Teamsters and other working-class people to better inform themselves about labor's struggles.
This is important now in a situation of war. For example, the airlines right now are playing a financial game with people's lives with announcements of layoffs.
Now's the time for labor to stand up.<BR>
--<B>William Jenkins,</B> member of Teamsters Local 743 and contributor to the "Labor Beat" cable TV program</P>
