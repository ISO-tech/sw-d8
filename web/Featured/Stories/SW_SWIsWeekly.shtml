<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>ANYONE WHO has attended a protest or a picket knows what it's like to open the newspaper and find your struggle misrepresented--or not reported at all.</P>
<P>That's just one reason why socialists and other radicals have always produced their own newspapers--to tell the story of struggles that the mainstream press won't.</P>
<P>But these publications also play an important role in helping activists to organize themselves and bring others into the struggle.</P>
<P>During the great Minneapolis Teamsters Rebellion of 1934, strike leaders--the core of them socialists--put together a daily strike newspaper called <I>The Organizer</I>. The paper "enabled the union to break the capitalist monopoly on the press, thereby cutting through the propaganda screen erected by the bosses," wrote Farrell Dobbs.</P>
<P>"The strikers and their sympathizers got an accurate account each day of key developments during the previous 24 hours&#133;The whole labor movement was alerted against dangers that arose, and the way to cope with them was carefully explained. Although only a two-page tabloid, the daily <I>Organizer</I> packed a wallop, and the working class of the city soon came to swear by it."</P>
<P>In the same way, <I>Socialist Worker</I> counters the lies of the bosses' press and gives a platform for our side--from union activists to death row prisoners fighting for justice. We take up discussions about the next step in our struggles and the political debates within our movement.</P>
<P>Ultimately, <I>SW </I>aims to show how the horrors of the society we live in have a root in capitalism--and that the struggles against those horrors can be linked. A fair, just and democratic world is possible--but we have to fight for it.</P>
<P>With this issue, <I>SW </I>has gone weekly--with the goal of strengthening our struggle for a better world.</P>
