<a name="ABC"></a><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>THE ABCs of MARXISM</b></font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-2/425/425_09_Marxism.shtml">Marxism is more relevant than ever</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Marx's ideas are alive because his indictment of capitalism--that it is a class society that creates great wealth for the few at the expense of the many, that it is prone to economic crisis and war--continues to be confirmed on a daily basis.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/606/606_13_Marxism.shtml">"Not a dogma, but a guide to action"</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"The reports of my death," wrote Mark Twain, "are greatly exaggerated." The same could be said of Marxism as a body of ideas.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-2/459/459_09_Marxism.shtml">Proving Marxist ideas into practice</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What is there to recommend Marxism over any other view of society and how to change it?</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-2/479/479_10_MarxTradition.shtml">The real Marxist tradition</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To Karl Marx, and generations of socialists after him, socialism wasn't about state ownership or party loyalty, but the self-emancipation of the working class.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-1/495/495_09_Socialism.shtml">Socialism: What will it look like?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"We know what you're against. What are you <I>for?" </I>is a question that we socialists get a lot.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-1/590/590_09_MakeSame.shtml">Isn't socialism about conformity?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Mass-market capitalism imposes conformity on the majority--at work, where we are expected to follow strict rules, and outside it, where we are treated as "mass consumers."<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-1/630/630_08_Laziness.shtml">The economics of laziness</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">No one can deny that people cease to be bored as soon as they are engaged in an activity they enjoy and are not compelled to do. Socialism eliminates these compulsions.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2003-1/437/437_09_MakingHistory.shtml">Can individuals change history?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Most history books treat historical change as the accomplishment of great men (and an occasional woman). The opposite, though less popular, view is that history follows a path which no individual can influence. Both ideas are mistaken.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-1/620/620_11_RunSociety.shtml">Can ordinary people run society?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Often, it is workers' hard-won, first-hand knowledge that engineers and managers use to figure out how to improve production--to squeeze as much out of workers as possible.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-2/431/431_09_WorkerUnity.shtml">What leads workers to fight together?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The same conditions that drive workers to compete with one another for jobs and that appear to impose themselves as "natural laws," also propel workers into collective struggle--into organizing and fighting back.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-2/467/467_09_Alienation.shtml">Alienation in capitalist society</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The term "alienation" in normal usage refers to a feeling of separateness--of being alone and apart from others. But for Karl Marx, alienation was an economic and social condition of capitalist society.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-1/616/616_13_Materialist.shtml">The materialist conception of history</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A defining feature of human life is social organization. Human beings, with the exception of shipwrecked individuals, appropriate their material needs as a group, not in isolation.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-2/515/515_09_History.shtml">What they don't teach us in school</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Why was history so boring in high school? Because textbooks talked about historical events as if they were a lifeless collection of things--like a grocery list, only you had to memorize it. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-2/550/550_12_ClassStruggle.shtml">Class struggle in the ancient world</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So long as society has been divided into classes and presided over by a ruling or exploiting class, there has been resistance from the exploited class.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-2/503/503_09_Progress.shtml">Are things getting better or worse?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The most common view of human progress is that there is no such thing. "History," says a character in James Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>, "is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake."</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-2/561/561_13_Enough.shtml">Is there enough to go around?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One of the most pernicious of all "common sense" ideas is that resources are limited, and, therefore, "difficult" choices must be made about who gets what.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/608/608_13_WorkersStruggle.shtml">Workers' struggle is the best school</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Karl Marx's concept of self-emancipation--that those who bear the chains of exploitation must themselves break them--was different from the ideas of other radical traditions.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-2/461/461_09_Substitution.shtml">No substitute for workers' power</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Workers cannot be freed by "philanthropic bourgeois" reformers. They cannot be freed by a heroic guerrilla force. The exploited and oppressed must free themselves--that was Marx's starting point.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-1/614/614_10_RulingIdeas.shtml">How the ruling class shapes the media</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The process by which ruling ideas are disseminated is sometimes very crude. But more often, direct interventions to shape media spin are not really necessary.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-1/487/487_09_Class.shtml">What we mean by the working class</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Class is commonly viewed as something based upon income level: upper, middle, lower. This view only serves to distort the real class issues that structure our society.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/594/594_13_ClassOppression.shtml">Marxism, class and oppression</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Marxism is sometimes presented as solely concerned with economic questions. But this emphasis doesn't prevent Marxists from dealing with questions of race and gender.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-2/421/421_09_Inequality.shtml">Can a revolution end inequality?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In all past revolutions, the universal goals expressed by their participants masked underlying differences. Appeals to the interests of humanity, "the people" or the nation covered over the fact that there were different class forces with differing ideas about the revolution's goals.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The first glimpse of a society run by workers</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-2/433/433_10_ParisCommune.shtml">The Paris Commune</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"The first step in the revolution by the working class," Marx and Engels wrote in <I>The Communist Manifesto,</I> "is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class." The Paris Commune of 1871 showed how.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-2/549/549_10_Socialism.shtml">What will socialism look like?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The truth is that societies of equality have already existed in one form or another, in all parts of the world, in what is known as "primitive communism." <p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-2/427/427_13_Dialectics.shtml">Marxism and the dialectic of change</b></font></A><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Marxism is, in a nutshell, the theory and practice of working-class emancipation. Marxism is also a method of looking at the world. One of the most important foundations of Marx's method was dialectical thought.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2003-1/441/441_09_Democracy.shtml">Their hollow talk about democracy</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We are told that government expresses the "will of the people." But phrases like "the people" disguise the fact that the U.S. is divided by class.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2003-1/435/435_09_USNotClassless.shtml">Why the U.S. isn't a classless society</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">U.S. citizens have long been force-fed garbage about this country being a land where there are no class divisions, where everyone is "middle class." These ideas come under severe strain whenever economic crisis begins to stalk us.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-2/463/463_09_Capitalism.shtml">How the capitalist system was born</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The violent wrenching of millions of peasants off the land was a necessary condition for the development of wage labor--which is the essential condition of modern capitalism. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A href="../2003-1/449/449_09_HaveNots.shtml">The "halves" and the have-nots</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 1562, three American Indians were brought to France. Coming from a society with "no practice of subordination or of riches or poverty, no contracts, no inheritances, no divided estates," the Indians were shocked at what they saw.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-2/429/429_09_Profit.shtml">The drive for profit at capitalism's core</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Profits are not the capitalists' just "reward" for owning everything. Rather, they represent the fact that workers are paid for only a part of the value they add to what they produce.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-2/559/559_09_Profit.shtml">How the bosses make their profits</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Capitalist wealth presents itself to us as, to quote Karl Marx, "an immense accumulation of commodities." And commodities are the product of labor.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-2/513/513_13_GoodCapitalist.shtml">Are there any good capitalists?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Scrooge-like behavior is built into the makeup of capitalism. If you're a capitalist, therefore, concern for your employees is actually bad for business.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/612/612_09_Charity.shtml">They offer charity instead of justice</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The press emphasizes Warren Buffett's generosity, but doesn't ask how it's possible for one man to have such wealth that he still has $6 billion when he gives four-fifths of it away.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-1/539/539_09_YourOwnBoss.shtml">"Being your own boss" is no solution</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One of the great dreams promoted in the U.S. is being "your own boss"--starting up a small business where there isn't anyone bossing you around for lousy pay and benefits.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-2/419/419_09_BoomBust.shtml">What's behind the boom-bust cycle?</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Capitalism's boom-bust cycle is central to its operation, not some temporary aberration. It is the product of the unplanned, anarchic nature of capitalism.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-1/525/525_07_Money.shtml">How to explain the mystery of money</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Money seems to possess mystical powers--pieces of paper or metal that seem to give their bearer the power to convert them into real objects. But there's nothing magical about money. <p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-2/641/641_08_Credit.shtml">The role of credit in booms and slumps</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The role that credit plays as facilitator of capitalist expansion creates a larger financial overhang when the crisis finally hits. It therefore makes both the boom and the crisis more extreme.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-1/455/455_09_Combined.shtml">Modern factories beside straw huts</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Capitalism has replaced "national exclusion and self-sufficiency" with the "universal interdependence of nations," as Karl Marx wrote. But capitalism as a world system did not spread smoothly and evenly.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-2/565/565_09_Bureaucracy.shtml">Capitalism and bureaucracy</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Profitable enterprises are supposed to be the guarantee against bureaucracy, but this claim by free-market ideologues fails utterly to describe reality.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-2/477/477_11_GradualChange.shtml">Is social change always gradual?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We're taught in school that change is something that happens gradually. But gradual change and big, qualitative leaps shouldn't be counterposed. They go together.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-1/485/485_09_Revolution.shtml">Workers' revolt to revolution</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Revolutions are windows of opportunity where the old habits of deference and passivity are suddenly destroyed on a mass scale among ordinary people.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-1/527/527_12_Spontaneity.shtml">Getting from anger to action</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many of what appear to be outbursts of spontaneous struggle have had the ground prepared for them by years of patient organizing.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-2/566/566_13_Organization.shtml">The question of organization</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Few leftists would deny that at least some rudimentary forms of organization are needed to fight exploitation and social injustice. But what kind of organization is necessary?<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-1/618/618_09_Authority.shtml">Are "anti-authoritarians" the real left?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Being against all authority has a certain radical ring to it, but if strictly adhered to is a recipe for confusion.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-1/622/622_10_Authoritarian.shtml">Is all organization authoritarian?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The error that anarchism falls into is believing that the means to achieve a classless, stateless society themselves must prefigure the end result.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-1/624/624_09_Anarchism.shtml">Saving Marx from anarchist distortion</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The working class can overthrow the political power of the ruling class, but it has not thereby created the immediate conditions for a free and classless society.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Russia's Bolshevik Party experienced both great advances and devastating retreats. At every major turn, the party went through serious crises over the best way to proceed.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-2/638/638_13_Reforms.shtml">The relationship of reforms and revolution</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Workers don't simply move from protesting and striking to wanting to overthrow capitalism. There is a process in which the experience of struggle wins them to these conclusions.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-2/505/505_09_StateAndRevolution.shtml">Can elections bring socialism?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The most popular view of the state, even among most radicals, is that its character can change if only the right people were to run it. History teaches us how mistaken a notion this is.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The historian Eric Hobsbawm calculates that 187 million people have died from wars in the last century. Given this grim picture, it's tempting to view war as something that is inherent in human nature. But it isn't.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2003-1/445/445_09_HostileBrothers.shtml">"Dividing the loot of others' labor"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Capitalists are like hostile brothers," Marx wrote. Throughout history, they have alternately fought each other--using armies made up of the same workers who produce their profits--and closed ranks to suppress working-class revolt from below.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2003-1/453/453_09_Empire.shtml">Bringing back the old days of empire</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The idea that the United States should cast itself in the image of the old colonial empires is sprouting like weeds from right-wing journals and think tanks.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-1/493/493_09_GreaterTerror.shtml">The greater terror of U.S. power</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The concept of a "war on terror" is a logical absurdity. For what is war if not terror--which is defined in many dictionaries as the systematic use of violence?</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-1/592/592_09_Haditha.shtml">Haditha: The rule or the exception?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Marines' actions at Haditha are counterposed to the presumably more reasonable attacks by the U.S. in Iraq. But can we make such a clean distinction?<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-1/535/535_09_Withdrawal.shtml">Why we argue U.S. out now</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Immediate or delayed withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq--this is one of the key questions confronting the antiwar movement today.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/598/598_09_FirstShot.shtml">Who fired the "first shot"--and when?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Trying to figure out who fired the first shot is a poor way to figure out which side, if any, has justice on its side.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/595/595_13_Israel.shtml">Why Israel is on the attack in Gaza</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Coverage in the U.S. media of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is presented through a camera obscura--a lens that turns images upside down. <p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/597/597_17_LebaneseCasualties.shtml">Israel's lies about Lebanese casualties</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If you didn't resist, we wouldn't have to destroy you--that's the Israel Defense Force's message to the people of Lebanon and Gaza.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/600/600_09_Israel.shtml">Israel--aiding the world's butchers</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the bourgeois media, as in war, truth is always the first casualty, often buried alive at the bottom of stories rather than killed outright.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-1/491/491_09_Haiti.shtml">Why U.S. troops should leave Haiti</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We would laugh off the idea of Haitian troops coming to Florida to supervise an election, but no one bats an eyelid when U.S. Marines patrol the streets of Port-au-Prince.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-2/563/563_09_OilandWar.shtml">Is the Iraq war just about the oil?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If world capitalism suddenly began running its businesses and militaries on something other than oil, would that end, or at least lessen, the threat of war? If only it were so easy.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2003-1/443/443_09_ObeyOrPay.shtml">Obey the U.S.--or pay the price</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The practice of the conqueror blaming the conquered for the casualties inflicted on them is as old as conquest itself. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-1/537/537_09_WarOnTerror.shtml">A kinder, gentler U.S. imperialism?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The talk about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction was an extremely flimsy excuse for the real motives of the U.S. invasion.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-2/604/604_13_Intervention.shtml">Is there a "good" U.S. intervention?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The tradition of anti-imperialism in the antiwar movement--principled opposition to U.S. intervention--is perhaps the weakest it has been in decades.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2007-1/634/634_08_Darfur.shtml">Asking a war criminal to stop war crimes</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Paul D'Amato writes an open letter posing some questions to Don Cheadle and other Hollywood figures who call for the U.S. to intervene to "save" Darfur.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2006-1/588/588_09_ImperialReach.shtml">Imperialism in liberals' clothing</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When a wolf attacks one farm, breaks into the coop and eats the chickens, no sane person demands that the wolf move to another farm where it can cause more mischief.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2003-1/439/439_09_WhiteMansBurden.shtml">The new "white man's burden"</b></font></A><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. has always projected its own narrow economic and military interests around the world as being in the broad interests of everyone on the planet. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2004-1/501/501_09_Gaza.shtml">No refuge for Rafah refugees</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since 2000, Israel has driven more than 11,000 people from their homes in the Rafah camp in Gaza--making refugees out of people who were already refugees.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We Marxists are internationalists. "Workers of the world, unite!" was the call of Marx and Engels in <I>The Communist Manifesto</I>. "You have nothing to lose but your chains." Does this mean, then, that Marxists turn their backs on national oppression? </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The publication of cartoons in Denmark caricaturing the prophet Muhammad belongs on a long list of caricatures of various peoples to justify colonialism.<p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="../2002-2/415/415_09_Family.shtml">Why the family oppresses women</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The family is the cornerstone of women's continuing oppression in our society. While the relation between men and women has changed immensely over the past few decades, women remain oppressed.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life." So wrote Karl Marx in his "Preface to a Critique of Political Economy." The American Civil War fits this description well.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You cannot equate the violence of the oppressor (designed to maintain oppression) and the violence of the oppressed (designed to free them from oppression).<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Just as the state, though it enforces the interests of the dominant exploiting class, appears to stand above society, law appears in the same way, as a fair arbiter between all of society.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the late 1800s, a series of famines ravaged India, killing tens of millions. They were triggered by droughts and bad harvests, but the real cause was man-made.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"We didn't cross the border, the border crossed us." This slogan of the immigrant rights movement expresses a historical fact--that much of the Western U.S. was once part of Mexico.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Joseph Stalin's regime had had nothing to do with socialism. His rule was consolidated on the ruins of everything the Bolshevik Party and Russian workers fought for in 1917.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The narrow choice offered in American politics of electing one capitalist politician to replace another has doomed the U.S. left to holding its nose and voting for something they don't want. Is there any alternative?</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="../2005-1/533/533_13_TwoParties.shtml">Can we change the Democrats?</a></b></font><br>
