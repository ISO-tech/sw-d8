<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many who recoil at the violence of our world declare their opposition to all forms of violence. But what of the basic right of self-defense?<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In a "globalized" world, isn't the very idea of class struggle outmoded? On the contrary, class and class struggle remain central in the U.S. today.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The free market is supposed to provide a measurement of what society needs. But in the real world, markets fail--repeatedly and predictably--to live up to their promise.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Critics of Karl Marx often dismiss him as a "dead, white, European man" whose ideas don't apply to--or are even at odds with--the majority of people around the world who are nonwhite. But the opposite is true--Marxism offers a solution for ending poverty and suffering around the world that's even more relevant today.</P>
