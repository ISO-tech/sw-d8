<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="377_01_ProtestingNotCrime.shtml">Why we're marching in Washington</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">They say that the U.S. is a beacon of democracy and human rights for the whole world. But in the capital city of that "democracy," the authorities will do anything to keep us quiet. When some of the world's most powerful men and women meet for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual conferences in Washington, D.C., later this month, they'll be protected by a nine-foot-high, two-and-a-half-mile-long, $2 million, chain-link-and-concrete fence.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Against the backdrop of Israel's stepped-up assassinations of Palestinian leaders, the Israeli Defense Ministry earlier this month announced a plan to create a "security zone" in the West Bank and Gaza.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since early August, U.S. warplanes have pounded targets in northern and southern Iraq at the rate of three or four raids a week. But you'd barely know it to read the mainstream U.S. press.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Nine feet high, on top of concrete highway barriers. A two-and-a-half mile perimeter, enclosing 220 acres of land. The U.S. government is building a fortress in the heart of Washington, D.C., to keep protesters from disturbing some of the world's most powerful people as they discuss policies that affect our lives.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Farmworkers from Southern Florida will hit the road this month for a nationwide Taco Bell Truth Tour. Taco Bell raked in $5.2 billion in sales in 1999. Meanwhile, farmworkers in Immokalee, Fla., who pick the tomatoes that go into Taco Bell products are lucky to make $7,500 for an entire year of backbreaking labor.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For months, the Bush administration and economic experts have insisted that the U.S. economic slowdown was "bottoming out." But the economy and hard-pressed consumers weren't listening.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. delegation to the United Nations World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa, was ready to walk as soon as it arrived.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Joseph Heard was delivered to jail on October 13, 1999. He spent nearly two years behind bars before authorities figured out that they'd made a mistake--the case against Heard had been dismissed, and he was supposed to have been set free.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It's okay to shoot someone five times and then brutally beat them...as long as you're a cop!

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The role of the mainstream press, to quote Karl Marx, is to reflect "the ruling ideas of society." <I>New York Times</I> journalist John Swinton put it more colorfully at his retirement party. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">D.C. police Chief Charles Ramsey says he needs a nine-foot-high fence and thousands of cops to "keep the peace" when protesters come to Washington to demonstrate against the IMF and World Bank. But that's par for the course today.</P>
