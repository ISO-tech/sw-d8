<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Unwelcome Boeing</font><br></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>by BRIDGET BRODERICK</b></font></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>CHICAGO--Protesters threw an "unwelcome" party September 4 for Boeing Corp. at its posh new headquarters here. The Anti-Boeing Coalition formed to protest $4.5 billion in tax breaks that the state of Illinois and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley used to lure Boeing to Chicago.</P>
<P>More than 50 people marched and chanted, "Money for health care, not for warfare," and "Boeing, Boeing, we cry shame, Star Wars is not a game!"</P>
<P>Miguel Morales of the National Boricua Human Rights Network told the crowd that Boeing manufactured the F-18 Hornet jet that killed David Sanes two years ago in Vieques. "We cannot allow the manufacture, sale and distribution of military arms whether we are from Vieques, Puerto Rico, Kuwait or Chicago."</P>
<P>Palestinian activist Hakim Hussein connected Boeing to the massacres in Palestine. "We don't want a polluting, racist company in Chicago," said Hussein. "We don't want a company that produces weapons for the ethnic cleansing of Palestine."</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Free Mumia Abu-Jamal</font><br></P>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>PHILADELPHIA--Activists are building for a September 15 demonstration to support Pennsylvania death row political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal.</P>
<P>Mumia's new lawyers are asking state court judge Pamela Dembe to consider new evidence in the case--including a signed affidavit from a man named Arnold Beverly, who says that he, and not Mumia, shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in December 1981.</P>
<P>The lawyers will file their brief in early September, and prosecutors will have two weeks to respond. Mumia's supporters hope the demonstration will put pressure on Dembe to hear the new evidence.</P>
<P>An August 17 protest drew some 2,000 people to Philadelphia for a rally and march outside the courthouse where Dembe held an earlier hearing.</P>
<P>Mumia's supporters will gather September 15 at 1 p.m. on the east side of City Hall.</P>
