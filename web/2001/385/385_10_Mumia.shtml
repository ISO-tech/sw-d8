<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>AS ACTIVISTS across the country prepare for a national day of action to get justice for Mumia Abu-Jamal, a state judge rejected Mumia's plea for a new trial.</P>
<P>Mumia Abu-Jamal, a Black journalist, was already a well-known critic of Philadelphia police brutality when he was framed for the murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner and sentenced to death in 1981.</P>
<P>In cities across the country, activists will mark the 20th anniversary of Mumia's death sentence with protests and marches.</P>
<P>In late November, Common Pleas Judge Pamela Dembe refused to grant Mumia a new trial, ruling out any opportunity for a new round of state-court appeals. Mumia has argued that his former lawyers were ineffective and that new evidence--a 1999 affidavit signed by a man named Arnold Beverly confessing to Faulkner's murder--clears Mumia of the crime.</P>
<P>Dembe's decision leaves Mumia's fate in the hands of Federal District Court judge William Yohn--who has already rejected the testimony of Beverly. Meanwhile, police in both Baltimore and Philadelphia have been harassing activists for putting up posters to mobilize people for the December 8 day of action.</P>
<P>We won't be intimidated. Winning justice for Mumia will require pressure in the streets.</P>
