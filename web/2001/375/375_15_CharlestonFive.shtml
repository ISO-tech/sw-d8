<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>CHICAGO--The AFL-CIO and the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition restated their support for the Charleston Five at their respective meetings here this month.</P>
<P>The Five are members of the International Longshoremen's Association in South Carolina who have been under house arrest for more than 18 months following a massive police attack on their union's picket line last year.</P>
<P>Conservative State Attorney General Charlie Condon plans to bring the Five to trial on felony riot charges that carry prison terms of up to five years.</P>
<P>At its summer meeting in Chicago, the AFL-CIO Executive Council passed a resolution backing the Five. "These charges are unreasonable, excessive, and unjust," the resolution stated.</P>
<P>"We welcome the support of allies from among civil rights, religious and community-based organizations, as well as support committees that are forming in cities from New York to Los Angeles. The AFL-CIO is proud to take a leadership role in the fight for the Charleston Five. We will wage and escalate this fight until they are free and justice is done."</P>
<P>The following week, Jackson used the Charleston Five as the theme of his speech at a labor breakfast at the Rainbow/PUSH convention. He called on labor and civil rights groups to organize a national march on Charleston this fall.</P>
<P>"Labor must go to the defense of the Charleston Five to save itself," Jackson told <I>Socialist Worker</I>. "We must challenge the South to stop these right-to-work laws, and to stop these prosecutions. This is a struggle for America's soul."</P>
