<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>U.S. kills thousands of Afghan civilians</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_01_WashWarCrimes.shtml">Washington's war crimes</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">U.S. officials insist the war in Afghanistan is a "war on terrorism" not a war against the Afghan people. But since the Pentagon has dropped 10,000 bombs on one of the world's poorest countries, that story has become harder to sell.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_12_DefendJobs.shtml">Defend our jobs! Defend our unions!</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">More than 225 teachers of the Middletown school district in New Jersey defied court injunctions against a strike and went to jail in their struggle for a fair contract. Meanwhile, 5,100 members of International Association of Machinists District 91 were on strike against aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_12_FastTrack.shtml">Bush's fast-track attack</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Earlier this month, George W. Bush rammed "fast track" free-trade legislation, now called "trade promotion authority," through the House of Representatives by one vote. Outrageously, he used the "war on terror" as an excuse.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_06_NewAfghanistan.shtml">Nightmare in the "new" Afghanistan</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To listen to the Pentagon, the village of Kama Ado is alive and well. Sure, U.S. warplanes dropped bombs nearby, but Pentagon spokespeople dismissed reports of civilian casualties from off-target bombs. However, up to half of the area's residents may have been killed.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Arafat faces mounting pressure from Israel and the U.S.</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_05_Israel.shtml">Israel lashes out</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Casualties continue to mount as Israel steps up its war on Palestinians following three suicide bombings at the beginning of December. In less than a week, more than 100 Palestinians--most of them children--were injured, and two killed.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"My name is Ali Al-Maqtari, and I want to tell you the story of how I was jailed by the INS for almost eight weeks&#133;Even though I did nothing wrong, and cooperated with the INS, FBI and Army in every way possible, I spent many weeks in harsh jail conditions, cut off from my wife&#133;"</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_03_Recession.shtml">Recession and the shape of things to come</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The official pronouncement that the U.S. is in recession came as Enron staggered into the biggest corporate bankruptcy ever. The business media pundits quickly declared that the two events were unrelated.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_02_SecretEvidence.shtml">Facing deportation on secret evidence</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After three and a half years of detention, Mazen Al-Najjar was freed last year when the "secret evidence" used to convict him didn't hold up. But now the 44-year-old Palestinian man is back in prison--and threatened with deportation--based on the same evidence.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_02_FBIRaids.shtml">FBI agents raid Muslim charity</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Stripping the rooms clean in raids that went on for hours, federal agents shut down offices of the Muslim charity Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development on December 4.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_02_EastTimor.shtml">U.S. approved attack on East Timor</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Recently released documents prove that President Gerald Ford and his administration gave the green light for Indonesia's 1975 invasion and annexation of East Timor--one of the most terrible war crimes in history. Indonesia's occupation cost the lives of as many as 200,000 East Timorese.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush's appeal to U.S. schoolchildren to contribute $1 to a fund for Afghan children was always an obvious public relations stunt. Just how obvious became clear in December.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There is no question that George W. Bush's "either you're with us, or with the terrorists" atmosphere has a certain Cold War ring to it.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_06_CanUNFixIt.shtml">Can the UN fix Afghanistan?</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The White House made it clear all along that it expected the UN to "take over the so-called nation-building" after the war, as George W. Bush put it in October. But this doesn't mean the U.S. is giving up its say-so over Afghanistan's future.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many U.S. politicians and media pundits have decided that Afghans--and other people in the Middle East and Central Asia--are unfit to rule themselves, with some openly calling for a revival of old-style colonialism.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="387_09_EconomistsCant.shtml">Why economists can't explain crisis</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"I say to my mom, 'Don't worry, there will not be another Depression,' and she says, 'Why not?' And I say I don't really know why not." This comes from an economic historian quoted in the <I>New York Times</I>. Economists seem unable to predict the onset of slumps, their duration, how they came about or how they will end.</P>
