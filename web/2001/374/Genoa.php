<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Full coverage of the Genoa protests</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Collected here are <I>Socialist Worker's</I> articles on the global justice demonstrations against the Group of Eight summit in Genoa, Italy.

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>300,000 defy police violence in Genoa protest</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="374_01_Genoa.shtml">Another world is possible</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">They came to protest a world of grotesque inequality and poverty. But the leaders of the eight most powerful countries on Earth had a different concern. They wanted to show who's boss. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The battle of Genoa</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="374_08_BattleInGenoa.shtml">"They are eight, we are 6 billion"</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Plenty of fine words flowed out of the 14th-century castle in Genoa, Italy, where the leaders of the world's most powerful countries met last month. But they sent their most important message a mile away, in a small square called the Piazza Alimonda--with two gunshots that killed Carlo Giuliani. Here, <I>Socialist Worker </I>presents eyewitness accounts of what happened in Genoa.</p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>U.S. solidarity action with Genoa protests</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="374_14_GenoaReport.shtml">Take on one of us, you take on all of us!</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Activists in cities across the U.S. organized protests and meetings in solidarity with the global justice demonstrations at the G8 summit in Genoa, Italy. </P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHAT WE THINK</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>We hold them responsible for the violence in Genoa</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="374_03_G8Assassins.shtml">G8 assassins</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Group of of Eight leaders spoke of the "tragedy" of the deadly police shooting of Carlo Giuliani during demonstrations in Genoa, Italy, last month. But these politicians all but pulled the trigger. </P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHAT WE THINK</b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="374_03_BushsWay.shtml">Bush's way or the highway</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">U.S. arrogance was so thick at the G8 summit in Genoa that even U.S. allies found it hard to take. </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>WHAT DO SOCIALISTS SAY?</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="374_09_FreeMarket.shtml">Does the market help the poor?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Before the G8 meeting in Genoa last month, George W. Bush declared that those who oppose the free market are hostile to the poor. The nerve of this guy!</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>THE MEANING OF MARXISM</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="374_13_Violence.shtml">Is violence necessary to win social change?</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The ruling class and their media are quick to condemn acts of violence as morally wrong or "counterproductive." But Italian authorities exposed their own hypocrisy in their attacks on global justice protesters in Genoa last month. </P>
