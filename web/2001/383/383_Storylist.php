<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The village of Chowkar-Karez no longer exists. Neither do most of the people who lived there. But that's what the Pentagon wanted. "The people there are dead because we wanted them dead," an unidentified military official told CNN.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Prosecutors in Charleston, S.C., are taking aim at five union dockworkers. And organized labor and civil rights activists will protest this attack across the U.S. and around the world on November 14.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A torchlight rally outside the courthouse in Charleston, S.C., will mark the opening day of the trial of the Charleston Five, followed by an International Day of Action on Wednesday, November 14.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The USA PATRIOT Act gives law enforcement at every level extraordinary new powers for domestic spying, searches, detainment and deportation. It should have been called the Big Brother Bill.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush promised that his "war against terrorism" would be based on a coalition of nations. But now that coalition "partners" are beginning to complain, the U.S. has a new message for all of them: We'll escalate the killing when and how we want--whether you like it or not.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="383_03_SchoolofAssassins.shtml">Shut down the School of Assassins</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"If any government sponsors the outlaws and killers of innocents, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves." That was George W. Bush's warning to foreign governments that "harbor terrorists" as the bombs began to fall on Afghanistan. For the last half-century, the U.S. military has run its very own terrorist training camp--at Fort Benning, Ga.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="383_03_Argentina.shtml">Argentina at the brink</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Once a showcase of neoliberal economic "magic," Argentina has become a basket case of neoliberal reality.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">On November 2, hundreds of firefighters--furious with new restrictions on how many could be at the World Trade Center site to help with recovering the remains of their comrades--marched on "ground zero," clashing with police who tried to bar their way.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>FBI looks for U.S. source of anthrax</b></font><BR>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A month after the deadly anthrax attacks hit the headlines, four people are dead, more than a dozen others are infected--and only now have authorities begun to admit that the attacks might well have come from "homegrown" terrorists.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="383_02_CIABinLadenMeet.shtml">We know what the CIA was doing last summer</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It's a strange way to treat "Public Enemy No. 1." But a leading French newspaper is reporting that the CIA met with Osama bin Laden when the U.S.-ally-turned-enemy was hospitalized last summer in the Persian Gulf state of Dubai.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">With the Bush administration preparing for a long war, student activists are showing that they're prepared to build an antiwar movement from the ground up. November 10-11 is slated as a weekend of student antiwar conferences in cities across the U.S.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For years, Democrats and Republicans tried to outdo each other to show their support for capital punishment. But since 1999, the number of executions has fallen two years in a row--for the first time in 25 years. This is the latest sign of growing doubts about the U.S. killing machine.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="383_07_USWarofTerror.shtml">U.S. government's war <I>of</I> terrorism</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The looming prospect of mass civilian casualties from slaughter and starvation makes it more difficult for the Bush administration to sustain its claim that "this war is not against the Afghan people." This is not a "war against terrorism"--it <I>is</I> terrorism.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>THE MEANING OF MARXISM</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="383_09_TwoArmsofImperial.shtml">The two arms of U.S. imperialism</A></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The argument, popular in the global justice movement, that corporate globalization undermines the "sovereignty" of states could, if unqualified, lead to the idea that you must rally around your "own" state. The result of such politics is now apparent in the wake of September 11 in a recent <I>Nation</I> article by William Greider, a critic of the ravages of corporate globalization.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The top U.S. military brass wanted a war. Their solution? Stage an attack on an American military base, followed by a series of bombings and shootings that could be blamed on terrorist opponents of the U.S. If this was submitted as a Hollywood movie script, it would be rejected as too far-fetched. But it's the truth.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Every day, the news is filled with more terrifying rumors about anthrax. But for the past month, the same media that have been whipping up anthrax hysteria have been lying to all of us who work near "Ground Zero" in New York City about the air that we've been breathing.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I am a teacher in Berkeley, Calif., and a member of the Berkeley Federation of Teachers (BFT). On October 18, those of us on the executive board of the BFT approved a resolution opposing the U.S. response to the tragic events of September 11.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A few days after the September 11 attacks, a cartoon ran in the <I>Daily Californian</I>, the student newspaper at the University of California-Berkeley, that showed two turbaned Arab men carrying flight manuals in hell. Antiwar and antiracist students demanded an apology from the editors of the newspaper, but the editor-in-chief refused, calling it "freedom of speech."</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Locked out workers once again said "no" to a union-busting contract proposal from Accuride that was pushed to a sudden vote by the UAW's International staff.
