<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><p>IT'S A strange way to treat "Public Enemy No. 1." But a leading French newspaper is reporting that the CIA met with Osama bin Laden when the U.S.-ally-turned-enemy was hospitalized last summer in the Persian Gulf state of Dubai.</P>
<I><P>Le Figaro</I> quoted unnamed sources saying that bin Laden was hospitalized at American Hospital in Dubai in July--and that he met with two CIA agents while he was there. The U.S. government was offering a multimillion-dollar reward for bin Laden at the time.</P>
<P>Officially, the hospital denies the report, and so does the CIA. But the conservative French paper's sources say that the CIA's chief for the region openly bragged about the meeting.</P>
<P>And it's widely known--though rarely mentioned in the U.S. mainstream media--that bin Laden had extensive contact with U.S. government operatives, dating back to the Afghan war against the former USSR's military occupation and continuing into the 1990s.</P>
