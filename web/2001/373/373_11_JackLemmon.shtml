<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">JACK LEMMON, who died at the end of June at the age of 76, didn't fit the classic image of a movie star. His close to 70 film appearances--plus eight Oscar nominations--qualified him as one.</P>
<P>But the characters he played weren't dashing or daring or suave. Lemmon is best known for portraying ordinary people, warts and all&#150;and showing them driven half-crazy by the world around them.</P>
<P>That was the core of Lemmon's frantic characters in the 1950s and 1960s comedies that made him famous&#150;like <i>The Apartment, The Odd Couple</i> or <i>The Out-of-Towners.</i></P>
<P>But though these films made his career, Lemmon bucked the Hollywood system to make other dramatic movies that will be remembered far longer.</P>
<P>In the 1970s, U.S. filmmakers--reflecting the social upheavals of the time--made movies like <i>The Godfather, Taxi Driver</i> and <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i> that broke the mold from what came before.</P>
<P>Lemmon made an important contribution to this trend with the 1973 film <i>Save the Tiger</i>--which only got made because Lemmon went to bat for the movie when studio bosses wanted to shut it down. <i>Save the Tiger</i> portrays a small businessman in the process of a breakdown--a fantastic film that's a commentary on both the dog-eat-dog logic of capitalism and the horrors of war.</P>
<P>In 1979, Lemmon starred in <i>The China Syndrome,</i> playing the strait-laced manager of a nuclear power plant who learns that the industry he's championed is putting the future of the planet at risk.</P>
<P>A few years later, Lemmon was the main character in <i>Missing,</i> where he portrayed the conservative, Christian Scientist father of a radical American journalist killed in Chile during the 1973 coup orchestrated by Gen. Augusto Pinochet and his friends in the CIA.</P>
<P>These movies are a testament not only to Lemmon's skill as an actor but to his commitment to political causes--a commitment that lasted to the end of his life. In the late 1990s, despite health problems, he starred in HBO remakes of several classic liberal movies, including the antiracist drama <i>Twelve Angry Men</i> and <i>Inherit the Wind,</i> a broadside against religious bigotry.</P>
<P>Most of these films can be found at any video store--and there's no better way to celebrate the life of this great actor than to have your own personal Jack Lemmon film festival.</P>
