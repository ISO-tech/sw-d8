<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">June 22, 2001 | Page 2</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">WASHINGTON--George W. Bush and his cabinet of CEOs have to be happy with the corporate mentality of the bureaucrat who looks after U.S. foreign aid.</P>
<P>Andrew Natsios is head of the U.S. Agency for International Development.</P>
<P>And in an interview with the <I>Boston Globe </I>in June, he displayed his ruthless commitment to efficiency.</P>
<P>Asked about the issue of AIDS in Africa, Natsios insisted that it would be wasteful for the U.S. to devote money to supplying life-saving drugs to those already infected with HIV--even though the so-called "drug cocktails" can stop the progress of the disease.</P>
<P>What is Natsios worried about?</P>
<P>Many Africans "don't know what Western time is," he told the <I>Globe. </I>"You have to take these drugs a certain number of hours each day, or they don't work.</P>
<P>"Many people in Africa have never seen a clock or a watch their entire lives. And if you say, one o'clock in the afternoon, they don't know what you're talking about."</P>
<P>In other words, Africans are just too ignorant to be given the drugs they need to survive.</P>
<P>Natsios isn't even correct by his own racist terms.</P>
<P>Toby Kasper, an official with the health organization Doctors Without Borders, told <I>New York Times </I>columnist Bob Herbert that the latest trend in drug cocktails is fewer pills, taken just twice a day.</P>
<P>But Natsios can't be interested anyway.</P>
<P>He told the <I>Globe </I>that his strategy is to "just keep talking about prevention."</P>
<P>In other words, just say no to AIDS.</P>
<P>Only a drug company executive could love this man. They prefer that their AIDS drugs not be distributed in Africa--so they can be used somewhere else to pump up the bottom line.</P>
