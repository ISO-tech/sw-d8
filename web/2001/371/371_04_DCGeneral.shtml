<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B>Dear Socialist Worker,</B></P>
<P>If Washington, D.C., had home rule--the right to govern its own internal affairs--like every other city and state in the country has, D.C. General Hospital would still be open today. </P>
<P>For the last year, Mayor Williams has tried to privatize D.C. General Hospital in the face of massive public opposition.</P>
<P>Of 12 hospitals in the District, D.C. General was the only public one--the only hospital obligated to serve the city's poor and uninsured. </P>
<P>D.C. has more than 70,000 uninsured residents who depended on D.C. General.</P>
<P>But the mayor complained that the hospital was losing money. </P>
<P>What Mayor Williams and his allied private interests can't seem to understand is that uninsured patients aren't so much profitable markets as they are human lives.</P>
<P>When the City Council voted unanimously to keep D.C. General fully funded, the mayor vetoed their plan. </P>
<P>The city council then voted unanimously to override the veto. </P>
<P>Case closed. Democracy had spoken. Right? </P>
<P>Wrong--because D.C. is not a democracy. </P>
<P>We elect a city council. And we elect a mayor. </P>
<P>But Congress and their handpicked "Financial Control Board Authority" have the power to overrule any decision made by our democratically elected representatives. </P>
<P>Birth control access, clean needle exchanges and commuter taxes--all passed by our elected officials or by voter referendum--have simply been overruled by Congress or the Control Board. </P>
<P>Yesterday, despite the objections of hundreds of protesters, the Control Board voted to overrule the city council and privatize D.C. General.</P>
<P>In D.C., we are apparently too poor, too Black, too Latino, too not-Republican to matter. </P>
<P><B>Dan Denvir, </B>Washington, D.C.</P>
