<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">ALMOST 700 people came from across the U.S. and around the world to participate in Socialist Summer School 2001 in Chicago in mid-June.</P>
<P>More than 100 talks at the summer school took up a wide variety of topics--from what's next for the antiglobalization movement to the origins of women's oppression to the novels of John Steinbeck.</P>
<P>"I'm totally impressed because I've been to a lot of these things, and it's clear to me how much work went into it and how well planned it was," said Kevin Danaher, a leading antiglobalization activist and cofounder of Global Exchange.</P>
<P>"The high level of energy is not just credit to the ISO, but it's also reflective of something that's going on generally in the movement. So I think you're on a surfboard on the crest of a wave."</P>
<P>The highlights of the weekend were the evening panels.</P>
<P>One on the struggle against racism in Bush's America brought together activists fighting police brutality in Cincinnati, racist violence at Penn State University and anti-Arab racism.</P>
<P>The next night, activists from around the world discussed the fight against corporate power--from Bolivia and Brazil, to Zimbabwe and Greece.</P>
<P>Oscar Olivera, a leader of the fight against water privatization in Bolivia, summed up the mood of the panel, declaring, "We believe a different world is possible."</P>
<P>Those who came to the summer school went home inspired by the struggles they heard about--and with new ideas about how to organize.</P>
<P>"I've been coming to summer school for three or four years now," said Lawrence Hayes, a former death row prisoner from New York City. </P>
<P>"You leave with so much knowledge, so much to think about. It offers a lot of answers to questions that come up at some point during your struggle."</P>
