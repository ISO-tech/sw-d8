<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>MOVIES: <I>Secrets of Silicon Valley, </B></I>produced and directed by Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Review by STEVE LEIGH</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> | June 22, 2001 | Page 11</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>SECRETS OF Silicon Valley </I>will eliminate any illusions you might still have about the "new economy."</P>
<P>This documentary illustrates in clear terms the reality behind the hype--that the high-tech wealth of Hewlett-Packard (HP) and other computer giants is built on the sweat, low wages and ill health of thousands of workers who toil for temporary agencies.</P>
<P>One beautiful feature of the movie is that it exposes the Internet millionaires as pompous and greedy slugs.</P>
<P>One executive tells us that the "new economy isn't about money but about knowledge"--only to later confess that "my money is my energy, my life force."</P>
<P>While computer company CEOs pontificate about how different everything is in the digital age, the movie shows how workers face the same problems as in other industries and other "ages."</P>
<P>Take Raj, a temp worker who speaks up for his coworkers at Hewlett-Packard and tries to organize them.</P>
<P>Raj points out that many of his coworkers have bronchitis, nosebleeds and other respiratory problems--conditions they didn't have before they came to work at HP's plant. </P>
<P>When he raises this on the safety committee, he's first removed from the committee--and then fired. </P>
<P>Another hero of the movie is Magda Escobar, who runs Plugged In, a computer training center for low-income people in East Palo Alto, Calif.</P>
<P>She struggles to find funding to keep her center open--and finally gets a modest donation from HP--what is, in fact, a drop in the bucket compared to the huge corporation's sales.</P>
<P>The truth is that HP has set production quotas at an inhuman pace--but workers, many of whom are people of color and immigrants, have few other options.</P>
<P>Most temps max out at $8 an hour. Compare that to HP's CEO, who rakes in more than $50 million a year! </P>
<P>But we shouldn't worry about this disparity, says Avra Miller, another Internet millionaire, because "greed isn't a bad thing if it makes people do good things."</P>
<P>The film ends by describing some of the "good things" that the greed of Miller and the others has brought about--Silicon Valley has some of the highest housing costs, the largest gap between the rich and poor and most superfund toxic sites of any area in the U.S.</P>
<P><I>Secrets of Silicon Valley </I>is a well-crafted film that presents the evidence and lets the audience draw its own conclusions.</P>
<P>The so-called "digital divide" is about more than who can afford the latest software. </P>
<P>Go see <I>Secrets of Silicon Valley </I>to find out why.</P>
