<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B>Dear Socialist Worker,</B></P>
<P>I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to read several of your newspapers, and I find them very interesting and to the point.</P>
<P>It's good that there is someone who has the courage to stand up against the injustice that is practiced in this so-called great country.</P>
<P>Pennsylvania has the largest population sentenced to life in prison in the U.S.--3,700 inmates--and it has an overall population of 38,000 and counting.</P>
<P>All of the state's funds are going to building these human warehouses--also known </P>
<P>as the prison-industrial complex.</P>
<P>When I was put in captivity in 1974, there were only six male institutions and one female.</P>
<P>Today there are close to 30 institutions for men, and another female prison has been in operation for a few years now.</P>
<P>They've hardly built a school here in the last 20 years or so, but in the last 10 to 12 years, many prisons have been built--thanks to Clinton and his so-called "war on crime" and "war on drugs."</P>
<P>The reality is it is a war on the poor.</P>
<P>I'm still striving to get justice, and I will continue to do so until the truth prevails.</P>
<P>And when I'm released, I will continue to speak out against this injustice.</P>
<P>Thank you for your time and the patience to hear me out.</P>
<P><B>Ameen McKelvie, </B>AF-5156, Chester, Pa.</P>
