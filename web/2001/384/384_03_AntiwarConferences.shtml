<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>THE ANTIWAR movement took a step forward this month with three regional student conferences held in Boston, Chicago and Berkeley, Calif., on November 10-11. In all, some 1,000 students and activists representing more than 125 campuses attended the meetings.</P>
<P>Each conference was larger than organizers expected, showing both the growth of antiwar sentiment on campuses and the desire of activists to strategize about how to build the movement.</P>
<P>Education was crucial to the success of the meetings. "I came to learn more about why this war is happening," said Sarah Roy, a student from Boston University. "I want to know more so I can go back to my friends and convince them to join us."</P>
<P>Each conference began with workshops and plenaries on questions facing the antiwar movement&#150;from what the U.S. government really wants in Central Asia to the struggle to defend civil liberties and the fight against racial profiling of Arabs in the U.S.</P>
<P>Other sessions were devoted to struggles that antiwar activists can connect with&#150;for example, the fight to shut down the School of the Americas.</P>
<P>The conferences also raised questions about how to organize. In Boston, for example, a serious debate took place over how to make decisions&#150;between a consensus model that requires agreement from every member of a group or majority voting.</P>
<P>Delegates from the campus groups supported majority voting by a wide margin, but a minority continued to raise the debate, finally threatening to walk out if their consensus model wasn't adopted.</P>
<P>Participants were frustrated by the time-consuming debate and the fact that it prevented more from being accomplished. Still, it's important for activists to settle questions about how to make decisions.</P>
<P>Political disagreements are natural in a movement, particularly as it grows. A democratic system of voting can ensure that different opinions are discussed and debated&#150;while activists unite to act around the decisions of the majority.</P>
<P>The conferences made plans for future actions&#150;including a coordinated day of protest in December and a national organizing conference early next year. Participants came away with the sense that the fight is moving forward.</P>
<P>"I was very inspired by the conference," said Rachel Miller, a student from Luther College in Iowa. "As far as activism goes, this is really a first step for me. I've been mostly a thinker. Now I'm really excited about acting on it."</P>
