<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>KING CITY, Calif.--After two long years, 750 International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 890 members are celebrating an amazing victory in their fight for a new contract at Basic Vegetable.</P>
<P>Basic Vegetable is a large producer of dehydrated onion, garlic and potato products. In the face of relentless union-busting attacks, the largely Latino workforce remained solid, and in the process, galvanized strong support from local residents.</P>
<P>Strikers won the right to return to work, an 8 percent wage increase over two years and protections against cuts in their seniority rights, health and welfare benefits, pensions and severance pay. </P>
<P>The fight began in July 1999 when arch-Republican William Hume, heir to an agricultural production dynasty, refused to negotiate a new contract with Local 890.</P>
<P>Founder of the right-wing lobbying group, Citizens for America--which backed several local anti-immigration and tough-on-crime measures--Hume tried to use the contract fight to break the union.</P>
<P>"The company has seven other plants, and I think they're using us to teach them a lesson," union organizer Fritz Conle said at the time. "They don't ever want to see a strike at any of their facilities again."</P>
<P>In response to Hume's demand for a wage freeze, a two-tier wage scale, subcontracting rights, the reduction of full-time hours and an eroded pension plan, workers went on strike.</P>
<P>Management intimidated strikers, suspended several workers on trumped-up charges and hired more than 100 strikebreakers who attacked strikers and a union staff member. Then Hume initiated a union decertification vote, taking advantage of an anti-union law that prevents striking workers from taking part in decertification elections after one year.</P>
<P>Refusing to back down, union members maintained the picket line and launched a massive community fight, which included candlelight vigils, window-poster campaigns throughout King City and a national boycott of Basic Vegetables.</P>
<P>Reaching out to students, hospital workers and prison employees, strikers toured California and convinced institutions to discontinue their orders of Basic Vegetable products.</P>
<P>After agonizing debate, the union voted to send nearly half of the membership back into the plant when Hume filed for the decertification election. As a result, Local 890 defeated Hume's decertification attempt and boosted the confidence of striking workers outside the plant.</P>
<P>Local 890's victory proves that a united membership and community support can beat back even the most vicious bosses.</P>
