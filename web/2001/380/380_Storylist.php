<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush promised a war that would bring "justice" and "end terrorism." But as <I>Socialist Worker </I>went to press, the dead in Afghanistan included hundreds of innocent civilians--with millions at risk of famine. And Bush was no longer even bothering to conceal the real aim of the operation.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">For the last century, the U.S. government has taken military action overseas about once a year on average.
