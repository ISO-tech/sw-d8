<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>IN THE early 1960s, the Pentagon's highest officials plotted to commit terrorist attacks inside the U.S. as part of a scheme to whip up public support for a war against Cuba.</P>
<P>The plans are revealed in a new book called <I>Body of Secrets</I> by reporter James Bamford. Bamford's revelations expose the scale of the Pentagon's fanatical hatred of the 1959 Cuban Revolution that toppled a corrupt and repressive U.S.-backed regime.</P>
<P>Citing official documents, Bamford says that the all of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff signed off on a proposal to commit terrorist atrocities and then blame Cuba's Fidel Castro. Among the schemes approved by the Joint Chiefs were killing Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s, sinking boats filled with Cuban refugees, hijacking planes and even setting off terrorist explosions in U.S. cities.</P>
<P>"We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba," reads one document cited by Bamford. "Casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation."</P>
<P>The generals even considered killing astronaut John Glenn by blowing up his rocket during a space flight--and then providing "irrevocable proof&#133;that the fault lies with the Communists."</P>
<P>The proposal was handed to the Kennedy administration in the wake of the disastrous CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. </P>
<P>Apparently, the White House rejected the plan. But the fact remains that the Pentagon was ready to orchestrate terrorism on U.S. soil to further its objectives abroad.</P>
