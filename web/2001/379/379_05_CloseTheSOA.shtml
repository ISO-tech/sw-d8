<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>SINCE THE September 11 attacks, TV news programs have dug deep into their archives to come up with footage of Afghanistan and Pakistan--a part of the world they ignored for years.</P>
<P>One popular clip replayed regularly on CNN shows young boys learning an especially hard-line brand of Islamic doctrine at religious schools in Pakistan.</P>
<P>These schools, commentators declared, are training grounds for terrorists. No one has presented any evidence that the September 11 hijackers had connections to these schools.</P>
<P>But there is one school with a well-documented record of teaching terror. It's not located in Pakistan, however.</P>
<P>It's at Fort Benning, Ga., in the heart of the United States.</P>
<P>More than 60,000 Latin American military and police officials have attended the School of the Americas (SOA) during its half a century of existence. There, they've taken courses in the Pentagon's latest techniques of repression.</P>
<P>And they've put their newfound knowledge to use at home--committing some of the most appalling and grisly atrocities in Latin America. "It is hard to think of a coup or human rights outrage that has occurred in [Latin America] in the past 40 years in which alumni of the School of the Americas were not involved," wrote the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>.</P>
<P>U.S. officials proudly declare that 10 Latin American presidents have graduated from the SOA. But each and every one took office by illegal means like a coup.</P>
<P>Last year, Congress voted to "close" the SOA--but to open up an SOA clone under a new name.</P>
<P>The name may have changed, but the SOA is still in the same business of teaching torture and terror. It should be shut down.</P>
<P>Tens of thousands of people will travel to Fort Benning for the annual demonstration against the SOA, set for November 16-18. Bush's war drive is sure to add momentum to the protests, which have grown in size and determination over the last several years.</P>
<P>It's time to tell Bush: We want America's school for terrorism shut down for good!</P>
