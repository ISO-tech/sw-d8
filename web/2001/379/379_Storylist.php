<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_01_StopTheWar.shtml">Stop this war!</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. has gone to war against one of the poorest countries in the world. George W. Bush dares to claim that the U.S. "is a friend to the Afghan people." But Washington doesn't care about their suffering--or about "justice" or "freedom" or any of the other rhetoric used to justify this cruel war.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Thousands rally against the war</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_16_AntiwarMovement.shtml">"We won't be silenced"</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"The only way they're going to hear us is in the streets. No to war! Yes to peace!" That was the message that Lucas Benitez had for the crowd of some 1,000 Chicago protesters who gathered--as did people in cities around the country--just hours after George W. Bush began raining bombs on Afghanistan.</P>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#990000"><b>WHAT WE THINK</b></font></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Truth is the first casualty in Bush's war on Afghanistan</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_03_USWarAims.shtml">The real U.S. war aims</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">U.S. bombs had barely begun falling on Afghanistan when George W. Bush announced that "the war against terrorism" could soon target other countries.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_03_SpreadResistance.shtml">Spread the message of resistance</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As the U.S. government's military assault on Afghanistan began, opinion polls showed wide support for bombing. But the mainstream media's enthusiasm for U.S. military might hid the fact that significant numbers reacted to the war by speaking out against it.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_Center.shtml">Can the U.S. bring justice?</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush says that his war on Afghanistan is about "justice." In this special feature, Howard Zinn, Ahmed Shawki and Sharon Smith explain why Bush's claim is a lie.</p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>The American flag:</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_05_Flag.shtml">"Symbol of a monstrous lie"</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The American flag is a symbol of injustice and oppression. Those of us opposed to Washington's war must march under a different banner--one that stands for international solidarity and justice.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>U.S. lies that justified the Gulf War</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_12_GulfWar.shtml">Operation Desert Slaughter</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush says that he wants to bomb Afghanistan in the name of "freedom and democracy." His father said the same thing when he went to war against Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><B>THE MEANING OF MARXISM</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_12_Hitchens.shtml">Who is the main sponsor of terror?</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Many liberals who may have voiced criticism of U.S. foreign policy in the past have enthusiastically signed on to Washington's war in Afghanistan.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_11_AntiwarResources.shtml">Resources for antiwar activists</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>Socialist Worker</I> writers recommend books on the history of the Middle East and Central Asia--and the U.S. military's bloody record of wreaking destruction around the globe.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_07_USNewBuddies.shtml">Bush's new best buddies in Afghanistan</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The politicians and their media mouthpieces are now painting the Northern Alliance as heroic and battle-hardened opponents of the Taliban's repressive regime. But the truth is a little different.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_07_RoguesGallery.shtml">A rogues' gallery of allies for Bush's war</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In its "war against terrorism," the Bush administration is embracing a rogues' gallery of governments that are among the most violent and antidemocratic in the world.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Hundreds of Arab Americans and foreign nationals were detained in the wake of the September 11 attacks, though most have been cleared of any connection to the suspected hijackers. But if Attorney General John Ashcroft gets his way, there will be more victims.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_02_StiflingDissent.shtml">Stifling dissent on campuses</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Right-wingers are using war fever to clamp down on dissent on college campuses. At City College of New York (CCNY), media pundits and school officials joined forces for an old-fashioned witch-hunt.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Right-wingers take aim at all dissent from the pro-war chorus</b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_11_MediaLapdogs.shtml">Wagging the media lapdogs</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the weeks since the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., right-wingers have gone on the offensive against critics of George W. Bush--and, in fact, any dissent from the pro-war chorus in the mainstream media.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_05_CloseTheSOA.shtml">Close the Army's school for terror</A></b></font><br>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Abdo Ali Ahmed lived in the small farm town of Reedley, Calif., for 35 years. He and his wife had six children--all are under the age of 12. On September 29, while thousands of people around the country attended antiwar rallies, two strangers walked into Abdo's store and shot him to death.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><A HREF="379_04_WhyNoFlag.shtml">Why I'm not waving the flag</A></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Like in most workplaces after September 11, a wave of patriotism overtook the garage where I work as a Verizon technician. I'm also a union steward. When the union leadership asked me to hand out American flags, I had to refuse. </P>
