<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Decent health care. That's the dream of millions across the U.S. But when all the grandstanding about the Patients' Bill of Rights is over in Washington, millions of Americans will be as far away as ever from decent health care. </font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The decision by Bridgestone/Firestone to close its tire plant in Decatur, Ill., is the result of management's relentless drive to make workers pay for corporate greed. By shutting down the plant and eliminating 1,500 jobs, Bridgestone/Firestone is hoping to scapegoat workers for its faulty--and deadly--tires.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At last month's United Nations (UN) conference in New York City on how to stop the global AIDS epidemic, some of the most committed fighters against the disease weren't invited.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The transfer of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague stinks of hypocrisy. Western countries aren't interested in justice, but in demonstrating that might makes right in the Balkans. But only <I>their </I>might, not Milosevic's.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The outrage over the shooting of protesters at the European Union summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, was still fresh last month when Spanish authorities viciously attacked a peaceful demonstration for global justice in Barcelona, Spain.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Democrats and Republicans are fighting a pitched battle over the Patients Bill of Rights legislation pending before Congress for the fifth straight year. Judging from the level of acrimony, one would think that a piece of sweeping workers' rights legislation is being debated.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush's energy plan is a disaster for the environment. Its goal is to gut regulations and let the oil and gas industry run wild. But even worse in some ways is its encouragement of the nuclear power industry--the deadliest form of energy ever devised.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><B><a href="372_13_CommittedFew.shtml">Can change be made by a committed few?</a></b></font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There are two opposing ideas that, strangely enough, are both attributed to Marxism. One is fatalism, the idea that history takes an inevitable course independent of what people do. The other is voluntarism, the idea that sheer will power can achieve anything.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The World Bank is notorious for its religious devotion to the free market as a cure for any and every social problem.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Late on June 30, as the clock was ticking down to a possible strike by American Airlines' 24,000 flight attendants, the company and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants announced a tentative contract. The deal came less than a week after Bush renewed his threat to prevent all airline strikes this year. </font></p>
