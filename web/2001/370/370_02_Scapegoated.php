<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>HORRY COUNTY, S.C.--"I didn't kill my baby," Regina McKnight repeated throughout her trial. But jurors took just 15 minutes to convict McKnight for "murdering" her stillborn child--because she smoked crack cocaine during her pregnancy.</P>
<P>Prosecutors argued that McKnight--who will serve 12 years in jail without the chance of parole--was a "reckless" addict, indifferent to what drugs might do to her fetus. It was a sick claim.</P>
<P>McKnight has an IQ of 72. The 24-year-old African American mother of three has been homeless for much of the last few years. She never smoked crack until her mother, who cared for her, was killed in a car accident in 1998.</P>
<P>When McKnight delivered a stillborn baby 35 weeks into her pregnancy, doctors found traces of cocaine in the systems of both mother and child.</P>
<P>At McKnight's trial, a Charleston pathologist testified that it's nearly impossible to determine the cause of stillbirths. But that didn't mean much in this South Carolina court.</P>
<P>Nor did it matter that McKnight desperately needs treatment for her addiction, not prison.</P>
<P>McKnight's conviction for homicide against an "unborn child" gives fuel to abortion opponents who argue for "fetal rights." State Attorney General Charles Condon--a fanatic Republican who has his eyes set on the governor's mansion--hailed the decision, declaring that South Carolina was "on the cutting edge of protecting the innocent life of the unborn as well as the born."</P>
<P>Condon and his buddies want to chip away at abortion rights--and use poor, drug-addicted women as scapegoats.</P>
