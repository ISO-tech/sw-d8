--George W. Bush</P>
</B>
<P>"GEORGE BUSH is the president&#133; Wherever he wants me to line up, just tell me where."<BR>
--CBS News anchor <B>Dan Rather</B> </P>

<P>"IF I see someone come in, and he's got a diaper on his head and a fan belt around that diaper on his head, that guy needs to be pulled over and checked."<BR>
--<B>Rep. John Cooksey</B> (R-La.)</P>

<P>"THE PERPETRATOR and those who give them safe haven should be in our bomb sights. I say bomb the hell out of them. If there's collateral damage, so be it."<BR>
--<B>Sen. Zell Miller</B> (D-Ga.)</P>

<P>"WE ARE not going to be reading anybody their rights. No one is covered by Miranda. Any country, any city, any region and any person who makes common cause with those who make war against America is making war against America, and the wages of sin is death."<BR>
--<B>Sen. Phil Gramm</B> (R-Texas)</P>

<P>"WE NEED to be prepared to act as if we are at war. And that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to strike back only at those that you know were the perpetrators&#133;I know this is going to sound awful, but my point is there is only one way to begin to deal with people like this, and that is you have to kill some of them, even if they're not immediately involved in this thing."<BR>
--Former Secretary of State <B>Lawrence Eagleburger</P>
</B>
<P>"ANY GOVERNMENT that shelters groups capable of this kind of attack, whether or not they can be shown to have been involved in this attack, must pay an exorbitant price."<BR>
--Former Secretary of State <B>Henry Kissinger</P>
</B>
<P>"THE TERRORIST organizations themselves and the terrorists don't have targets of high value. They don't have armies and navies and air forces that one can go battle against. They don't have capital cities with high-value assets that they're reluctant to lose. Some of the countries that are harboring terrorist networks do, in fact, have high-value targets."<BR>
--Secretary of Defense <B>Donald Rumsfeld</P>
</B>
<P>"WE'VE GOT to stop talking as if this is a crime--this is war. We're going to have to begin killing people. It's not about bringing people to justice. It's about going after them and killing them."<BR>
--<B>Eliot Cohen,</B> director of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University</P>
