<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">PETE MOORE, a longtime member of the International Socialist Organization, died tragically in a car crash on September 16.</P>
<P>Pete joined the ISO in 1978, about a year after it was founded. Though he suffered from a congenital arthritic condition that eventually confined him to a wheelchair, Pete was an active member in Chicago for much of the 1980s and during the 1990s.</P>
<P>The 1980s were a difficult time for socialists, swimming against the stream of the conservative Reagan era. The commitment of individuals like Pete and others helped to keep the socialist tradition alive.</P>
<P>And it laid the basis for the ISO to grow dramatically during the 1990s--from a small group meeting in the living rooms of members like Pete to an organization of some 1,000 members today.</P>
<P>Earlier this year, Pete parted ways with the ISO. But he remained politically active and committed to socialism.</P>
<P>Our thoughts are with Pete's family and friends. A memorial service is planned for October in Chicago.</P>
