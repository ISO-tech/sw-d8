<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>U.S. POLITICAL leaders lashed out far and wide after the air attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. But not wide enough for bigot Jerry Falwell.</P>
<P>During a chat with fellow Christian Rightist Pat Robertson on "The 700 Club," Falwell managed to blame a large part of the U.S. population for the attacks.</P>
<P>Falwell started out by saying that God had allowed "the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve." Then he really got going.</P>
<P>"The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked," Falwell declared.</P>
<p>"And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, the People for the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America, I point the finger in their face and say, 'You helped this happen.'"</P>
