<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="378_01_NoWar.shtml">No to war! No to racism!</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">George W. Bush wants to turn your grief into a blank check for war. His message is for everyone--in Afghanistan, in the U.S. and around the globe: What we say goes. But people around the U.S. have stood up to send a message to Washington: Not in our name.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Handmade posters of those missing in the World Trade Center tragedy were still being posted by family and friends of the victims a week after the air attacks. But George W. Bush had a different kind of poster in mind: "Wanted: Dead or Alive."</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="378_03_BuildStruggle.shtml">Build the struggle against war</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To listen to media and the Washington establishment, the entire country has fallen in love with George W. Bush. But thousands of people in every city across the U.S. are proving the establishment wrong.</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="378_03_BottomLine.shtml">Sacrificing for their bottom line</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">While people around the world mourned the victims of the September 11 attacks, big business mourned its bottom line.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><I>Socialist Worker </I>spoke to a number of opponents of Bush's war drive and asked them to explain why they say no to war and hate.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="378_05_Opposition.shtml">Speaking out against war</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Within a week of the attacks in New York and Washington, every major city in the U.S. and many more towns and college campuses saw events of all kinds to oppose Bush's war drive and the tide of racist attacks on Arab Americans.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="378_02_Crackdown.shtml">The rights they want to take away</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">White House officials are planning sweeping new attacks on civil liberties as part of their "war on terrorism"--and almost every politician in Washington, Democrat and Republican, is going along for the ride.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="378_06_RushToJudgment.shtml">Rush to judgment</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. wasted no time before declaring Osama bin Laden as its number one suspect in the air attacks on New York and Washington. There was only one problem: Lack of evidence.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Since the attacks, political leaders have constantly referred back to the image of the U.S. that everyone learns in grade school--that America has always been a beacon of democracy, a "shining city on a hill." But U.S. history tells a very different story.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Almost immediately after the attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., Israel's war against the nearly year-old Palestinian uprising took on a new ferocity.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The September 11 attacks took thousands of innocent lives--a horrific act of violence by any account. But United Nations (UN) sanctions against Iraq--kept in place since the 1991 Gulf War at the insistence of the U.S. government--take the lives of 5,000 children every month.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><a href="378_10_GreatGame.shtml">Return of the "great game"</a></b></font><BR>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The U.S. government is pursuing its own agendas and those of the major corporations that back it--and freedom, human rights and justice have nothing to do with it.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The "Washington consensus"--imposing U.S. economic interests around the world through "free trade" deals and structural adjustment programs--isn't suspended while the U.S. pursues its war. On the contrary, this is its military extension. </P>
