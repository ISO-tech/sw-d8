<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Washington politicians say that the U.S. war on Afghanistan isn't against the people of Afghanistan. Tell that to Mauroof. U.S. bombers killed more than 20 people on October 21 in the village of Torai--and ten of the dead were his relatives.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Layoffs announced this year have already exceeded the levels of the 1990-91 recession. Much of the rise in joblessness has been blamed on the September 11 attacks, but job losses were mounting long before, as the U.S. sank into recession.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Some of the most authoritarian and corrupt regimes in the Middle East are the U.S. government's favored allies in the "war against terrorism."

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"So what should the U.S. do?" Most opponents of the U.S. government's war on Afghanistan have been asked this question. If the bombing campaign is only causing more misery and making the crisis worse, then what do we propose?</P>
