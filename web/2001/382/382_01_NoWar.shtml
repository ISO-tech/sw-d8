<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>THE WASHINGTON politicians say that the U.S. war on Afghanistan isn't against the people of Afghanistan. It's a war to bring the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks to justice, they say.</P>
<P>Tell that to Mauroof. U.S. bombers killed more than 20 people on October 21 in the village of Torai where Mauroof lives. Ten of the dead were his relatives--his mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, three brothers-in-law, and four nephews, all of the boys under the age of eight.</P>
<P>"I saw the body of one of my brothers-in-law being pulled from the debris," Mauroof told a reporter. "The lower part of his body had been blown away. Some of the other bodies were unrecognizable. There were heads missing and arms blown off."</P>
<P>U.S. war planners say that the bombing of Torai was a regrettable mistake, and they're sorry. Like they were sorry when they obliterated the village of Karam. Like they were sorry when they bombed a hospital in Herat. Like they were sorry when they bombed a Red Cross warehouse in Kabul filled with desperately needed food and supplies--twice.</P>
<P>But none of these "mistakes" has stopped Washington's war makers. In fact, they escalated their bombing campaign last week--raining more terror from the skies over Afghanistan.</P>
<P>After the September 11 attacks, the politicians told us we needed to stand united as a nation. But when it came to the anthrax crisis, some people were more equal than others.</P>
<P>When Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's office received a letter with anthrax, all of Congress shut down, and every worker was tested for exposure. But nearly a week passed before workers at the Brentwood postal facility that handled the mail got the same treatment--and then only after two workers died.</P>
<P>Washington told us that all Americans were in the same boat in the "war against terrorism." But some are taking the opportunity to line their pockets.</P>
<P>When Congress got back to work, at the top of its agenda was a tax cut that will benefit corporations and the wealthy to the tune of $70 billion. Under White House-backed legislation that passed the House, the wealthiest 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers will get 41 percent of the cuts in individual taxes, while the bottom 60 percent will receive a paltry 7 percent of the benefit.</P>
<P>The politicians say this is to defend freedom. But the new antiterrorism legislation signed into law last week gives federal authorities the power to detain noncitizens indefinitely if they're declared a "national security threat"--and to subject any group exercising its basic right to protest to wiretapping and even criminal prosecution.</P>
<P>Whatever pretty words Washington uses to dress up its war drive, the truth is that the U.S. government is trampling on justice, human rights and freedom--here and abroad.</P>
<P>We have to organize to stop this war before the nightmare gets worse.</P>
