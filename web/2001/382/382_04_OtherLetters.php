<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5"><b>Stepping up the war on immigrants</b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>This morning, one of my coworkers who lives in Tijuana told me that he waited from 2:30 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. to cross into San Diego, when it usually only takes minutes.</P>
<P>Since the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Mexican workers who rely on jobs in the San Diego area have been suffering. Long lines, intrusive searches and frequent closures of the border are adding aggravation and humiliation to the days of most Mexican workers here.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the environment of hysteria has given confidence to every right-wing and nationalist crank out there to exploit the tragedy by targeting immigrants.</P>
<P>Besides reports of attacks on Muslims and Arabs (which are hardly mentioned in the mainstream press), racists are going after Mexican Americans. A family in San Diego county that was flying a Mexican flag in celebration of Mexico's Independence Day had a rock thrown through their window--with a note that said, "How dare you fly a foreign flag on a day like today?"</P>
<P>I'm sure that I'm joined by many, many people in my disgust at this kind of racism. The right may feel confident now, but we can discredit them before a public that rejects this kind of racist trash.</P>
<B><P>Chuck Stemke, </B>San Diego</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>"We may not want them marrying our daughters, but anyone who is willing to drive a plane into a building to kill Jews is alright by me." This is what Billy Roper, deputy membership coordinator of the neo-Nazi National Alliance said about the September 11 tragedy.</P>
<P>On July 29, many D.C. activists, myself included, helped organize a counter demonstration to the National Alliance's rally at the German Embassy.</P>
<P>These neo-Nazis tried to portray their demonstration as a rally for "free speech" in Germany and for the freedom of so-called "political prisoner" Hendrik Moebus (an admitted neo-Nazi who strangled a 15-year-old boy to death in Germany in 1994 because the boy wasn't "Aryan").</P>
<P>As the demonstration started, a scuffle broke out, and Roper got a well-deserved gash over his eye. I felt no mercy for this guy, but I also didn't injure him.</P>
<P>About 45 minutes into the demo, the cops pulled me out of the crowd and illegally asked Roper to identify me. He did so, even though he knew I was innocent. Me and another kid got charged with "simple assault."</P>
<P>My case looks pretty good, but the cops had no right to arrest me.</P>
<P>On top of all that I said, these scumbags are planning to hold a rally at the Israeli embassy three days after my trial. I am no friend of Israel--a state that is racist to the core--but I am no anti-Semite, either. If this means I have to defend the Israeli embassy against Roper and the rest of his crew, so be it.</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><B><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker</I>,</P>
</B><P>I am a socialist, and I believe in most of the things other socialists believe in, but this war is the one case where I must disagree.</P>
<P>There is strong proof that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the World Trade Center attacks; he even confessed to it!</P>
<P>We sat on our hands when the two U.S. embassies and the warship were bombed, and now look what has happened.</P>
<P>The government of Afghanistan knows about all of these things, and they still will not hand bin Laden over to us.</P>
<P>If we let this go, bin Laden will bomb cities next. We have got to protect our nation and make it safe again.</P>
<P>I am against violence and war myself. But they are necessary in this case.</P>
