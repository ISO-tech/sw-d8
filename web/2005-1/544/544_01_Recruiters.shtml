<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THE U.S. military is having trouble recruiting enough people to fill its ranks. And now Pentagon officials admit that they're also having trouble getting their recruiters to follow the law.<p>
On May 20, the U.S. Army's 7,500 recruiters will halt recruiting activities for a day to hold a nationwide "values stand-down." "It's ethics-under-pressure training," said Douglas Smith, spokesperson for the Army's recruiting command. "Some of it is simply part of an Army-wide reaffirmation of ethics. It also is directly related to the allegations that we've seen of recruiting improprieties."<p>
This is an admission that recruiters are bending the rules--or worse--to meet recruiting quotas.<p>
In Ohio, one family reported that recruiters signed up their mentally ill son, even though the Army's own rules forbid this. "David McSwane, a 17-year-old who lives outside Denver, also recently caught one recruiter on tape, advising him on how to create a fake diploma, and another helping him buy a product that purportedly cleansed his system of illegal-drug residue," the <i>New York Times </i>reported. One recruiter gave laxatives to a recruit so that he could quickly shed weight and pass an Army physical.<p>
In several cases, recruiters have threatened their targets with jail or arrest for missing an appointment or trying to get out of enlistment.<p>
For three months in a row, the Army has failed to meet its recruiting quotas, and the Marines haven't met their goal since January. One reason is obvious--mounting U.S. casualties in the occupation of Iraq. In addition, counter-recruitment efforts by activists on campuses nationwide have presented new obstacles for recruiters to overcome.<p>
The pressure that Army officials put on recruiters is so intense, however, that some told the <i>New York Times </i>that "they were not convinced the content of the training would be meaningful. [These recruiters] said they saw it as a routine day of safety training, with a dose of ethics as an afterthought."<p>
