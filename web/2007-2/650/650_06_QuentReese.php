<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">WE IN Austin are mourning the loss of our dear comrade, Quent Reese, who tragically took his own life after a long struggle with depression.<p>
Quent had a very basic sense of the injustice of the world that marked his whole outlook. He could argue the case for a different and better kind of world in terms that were persuasive, but not doctrinaire. And there was no gap between Quent's beliefs and his practice. He brought a professional flair and dedication to the ISO and the Campaign to End the Death Penalty (CEDP), perhaps his favorite cause.<p>
Quent joined the ISO in late 1990s while a student at the University of Texas. He cut his activist teeth in the UPS strike and a mass anti-racist student movement. As a fairly new activist, he preceded Jesse Jackson in a speech to a crowd of 5,000 students rallying against an anti-affirmative action law professor.<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quent's wish was that donations in his memory be given to the cause of helping Rodney Reed. Make checks payable to Rodney's mother, Sandra Reed, and send to: Prof. Dana Cloud, UT-Communication Studies, 1 University Station A1105, Austin, TX 78712.

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Quent was among a group of activists arrested at a sit-in at then-Gov. George Bush's mansion in the struggle to save Gary Graham/Shaka Sankofa from execution. From the beginning, Quent has been dedicated to the cause of saving Texas death row prisoner Rodney Reed.<p>
The first CEDP member to be a pen pal to Kenneth Foster Jr., Quent brought the peculiar details of the case to the group. He recognized Foster as a fellow revolutionary and helped launch the movement that saved Foster from execution last summer.<p>
Quent was gently persuasive, but when called for, he had a sharp combative streak. He wasn't afraid to stand up to power or someone defending injustice. Quent will also be missed for his sensitivity and funny, dry sense of humor.<p>
Quent was one of the good ones. A dear friend, he will always be remembered and sorely missed.<br>
