<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I'M WRITING to thank Christopher Henderson for his letter expressing sympathy for me and the many others who knew and loved Josh Brand ("Sympathy for a sad loss," August 3). It was a gesture that touched me deeply, and I know that Josh would have loved it, too. Thank you so very much, Christopher.<p>
I would also like to report on the outrageous treatment I received from the Baltimore City Police Department after finding Josh and calling 911.<p>
A uniformed officer offered me the chance to ride with Josh to the local hospital, so of course I ran to the ambulance at full speed and jumped into the passenger seat. I'd been sitting there for about one minute when a different officer approached me and informed the driver that I would have to stay at the scene.<p>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I was removed from the ambulance and repeatedly questioned by three or four different cops, including a homicide detective. Two of the cops had no qualms about joking around and chuckling among themselves, while I sat on Josh's staircase and sobbed. One detective actually said something to the effect of, "Some job. All these bodies and suicides." I'm a case manager for people with mental illness, so I'm familiar with the phenomenon of compassion fatigue, but damn!<p>
I was then taken to the homicide unit of the local police station, where I was made to sit in a waiting room for 30 to 45 minutes before being taken to an interrogation room and questioned again.<p>
I should mention, by the way, that I asked to see a counselor several times during this whole ordeal. The response I got? "As soon as we're finished with you." Protect and serve, my ass.<br>
