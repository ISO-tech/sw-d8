<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THE WHITE House didn't want anything to spoil George W. Bush's view during this week's visit to Britain. No matter how many rights that British authorities would have to shred.</P>
<P>Spokespeople for the Stop the War Coalition in Britain--where as many as 2 million people turned out to the huge antiwar march a month before the invasion--are hoping that tens of thousands will protest Bush on November 20. But U.S. officials demanded a rolling "exclusion zone" around Bush and a ban on marches in parts of London--to keep demonstrators from "appearing in the same television shots," as one newspaper reported.</P>
<P>The Stop the War Coalition initially said that police told them they would be banned from demonstrating in Parliament Square and Whitehall--the equivalent of Washington, D.C., cops saying that protesters wouldn't be allowed near the Capitol building or the White House. "[O]ne gets the feeling that there is a bigger hand somewhere that is trying to prevent a march going along Whitehall and past Parliament Square," Jeremy Corbyn, a member of parliament and leading figure in the Stop the War Coalition, told the BBC. "The Americans are actually running the security operation in London as well."</P>
<P>But with a few days to go, police suggested that the march would be allowed to go ahead. Meanwhile, at a question-and-answer session, George Bush said that he "welcomed" the planned protests. "I'm so pleased to be going to a country which says that people are allowed to express their minds," Bush said. Do you believe him?</P>
