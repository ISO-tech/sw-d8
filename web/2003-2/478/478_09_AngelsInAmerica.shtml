<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Review by Alan Maass</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> | December 5, 2003 | Page 9 </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B><I>Angels in America, </B></I>directed by Mike Nichols, written by Tony Kushner based on his play, starring Justin Kirk, Patrick Wilson, Al Pacino and Mary-Louise Parker. Showing on HBO starting December 7.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">IF <I>ANGELS in America </I>gets the audience it deserves when it debuts on HBO this weekend, some right-wing buffoons may be wishing they hadn't hounded CBS's <I>The Reagans </I>off the air.</P>
<P>Conservatives went on a rampage about <I>The Reagans </I>mini-series because it wasn't respectful enough about their hero. But <I>Angels in America </I>has nothing but contempt for Ronald Reagan and the miserable years of right-wing fanaticism that he presided over as president in the 1980s.</P>
<P>Tony Kushner's magnificent two-part, seven-hour play was first performed on stage more than a decade ago. Now it has been turned into a movie--to be broadcast in two parts on HBO, with the original script almost intact, and some of the best actors around performing in it.</P>
<P>At the heart of the story is the very issue that the right went crazy about with <I>The Reagans</I>--the AIDS epidemic. <I>Angels in America </I>is explicit about how Reagan's anti-gay bigotry and silence about the disease is directly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands.</P>
<I><P>Angels in America </I>is also about many other things, political and not--the Republicans' manipulation of the federal courts, religion and why people maintain their faiths, the meaning of loyalty and responsibility to those closest to us in a world of tragedy and screwed-up priorities.</P>
<P>It will do your soul good to hear Kushner's characters heap abuse and mockery on Reagan and his gang of narrow-minded bigots. But the story is also driven by a spirit of resistance, as its chief character, Prior, who suffers from AIDS, travels to the heavens to plead for "more life"--for himself, but also for a society that is being ruined by greed and hatred.</P>
<P>His final words--"The Great Work Begins"--is a call to action against everything that Ronald Reagan represents. It's a message that bears repeating today.</P>
