<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A RELIGIOUS fanatic made a televised announcement in mid-July calling for the death of three U.S. public officials. But no one in the Bush administration flinched. Why? Because the fanatic was arch-conservative, Christian Righter Pat Robertson.</P>
<P>On the Christian Broadcasting Network's <I>700 Club, </I>the King of the Bigots launched a 21-day "prayer offensive," asking viewers to pray for the "removal" of three Supreme Court justices, following their 6-3 decision overturning a Texas anti-sodomy law in June.</P>
<P>The ruling "has opened the door to homosexual marriage, bigamy, legalized prostitution and even incest" Robertson said in a letter on the CBN Web site. Robertson described the justices he wanted taken out: "One justice is 83 years old, another has cancer and another has a heart condition. Would it not be possible for God to put it in the minds of these three judges that the time has come to retire?" </P>
<P>What's next? Holy war?</P>
