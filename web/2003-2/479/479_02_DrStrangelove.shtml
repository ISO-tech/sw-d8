<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">GEORGE BUSH and his administration of Dr. Strangeloves are marching ahead with plans to build new "useable" nuclear weapons. In late November, Bush signed a bill that quietly allocates million of dollars for research into new bombs.</P>
<P>Tucked into the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2004 is funding for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons programs. The bill includes $7.5 million to study the possibility of converting conventional warheads into so-called "bunker-buster" nuclear bombs that are designed to destroy underground targets and hidden weapons arsenals.</P>
<P>An additional $6 million was set aside to study "low-yield" nuclear weapons that supposedly would be more useful in high-precision strikes. Never mind that scientists doubt whether the bombs could ever be made to work effectively--and that it's impossible for such bombs not to contaminate the environment with radioactive fallout.</P>
<P>"It is dangerous and provocative," Bob Schaeffer, of the Anti-Nuclear Alliance, told Britain's <I>Guardian </I>newspaper. "It is like a drunk preaching temperance to everyone else at the bar, while ordering another round."</P>
