<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THE BUSH administration claims that the president's Thanksgiving Day trip to Iraq wasn't a photo-op. But the proof is in the turkey.</P>
<P>Remember the now-famous picture of Bush, wearing an Army workout jacket and surrounded by soldiers as he cradles a platter with a golden-brown turkey? The bird looks perfect, with bunches of grapes and other trimmings completing the Norman Rockwell image.</P>
<P>But administration officials recently admitted that Bush picked up a decoration, not a serving platter. A contractor--from a subsidiary of Halliburton, naturally--had roasted and primped the decorative turkey to adorn the buffet line.</P>
<P>The 600 soldiers were served from cafeteria-style steam trays, "the officials said. They said the bird was not placed there in anticipation of Bush's stealthy visit, and military sources said a trophy turkey is a standard feature of holiday chow lines. </P>
<P>"This [visit] was effective, because it captured something about the president that people know is true--that he really cares about the soldiers and gets emotional when he sees them," said Republican pundit Mary Matalin. "You have to figure out how to capture the Bush we know, even if it doesn't come through in a speech situation or a press conference. He regularly rejects anything that is not him."<BR>

<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">POOR OLD McDonald's. Just as the world's largest fast-food chain was trying to spruce up its image (and its profits), it has been dealt another blow. Welcome to the world of "McJobs,"--defined by the latest Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary as "low paying and dead-end work."</P>
<P>The entry is one of 10,000 additions to the latest version of the dictionary. McDonald's is furious. Jim Cantalupo, the company's chief executive said in an open letter that it is "an inaccurate description of restaurant employment" and a "slap in the face to the 12 million men and women" who work in the restaurant industry.</P>
<P>McDonald's operates 30,000 restaurants around the world. Of the men and women who own and operate them, Mr. Cantalupo goes on, more than 1,000 got their start in a "McJob," serving customers--for low wages and no benefits, of course.</P>
<P>A McDonald's spokesman said the word "McJob" closely resembles McJobs, the company's training program for handicapped people. "McJobs is trademarked, and we've notified them that legally that's an issue for us as well," he added. In other words: McDonald's may sue the dictionary.<BR>

Too many whites are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send them up the river, too."<BR>
