<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P><B>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</I></B></P>
<P>As a progressive voter with a decidedly "socialist" perspective, I would like to comment on your article about not voting for the Democrats (<I>SW</I>, July 18). </P>
<P>Dennis Kucinich would be the answer to all our problems, yet your take on him only mentions his one "error"--that he did not, earlier in his career, believe in the right to choose abortion. Everyone's opinions evolve. The rest of his platform is just what a socialist would believe. </P>
<P>I think it is a mistake to downplay him and especially to badmouth him. He might be the only hope this country has! </P>
<P>I feel fear and trepidation to think that Bush would be elected to a second term. Socialists need to reconsider what is important right now. We can have the "power of the people" come through in this next election--but we won't if there is bickering over small points without considering the bigger picture. </P>
<P>We must get Bush out--but we can't have another "centrist" in office either! Kucinich is <I>not</I> a centrist. He is for labor. He is for the environment. He is for cutting military spending and for cutting back the Pentagon's budget to filter those monies into education. He is for women's rights. He is for funding Head Start and other social programs for the poor. In fact, he is for national health care--which will help everyone, especially the poor. And he is for sustainable energy and breaking the backs of the big corporations. </P>
<P>What else do we want?</P>
<P><B>Paula Morris, </B>Park Forest, Ill. </P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P><B>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</I></B></P>
<P>I wanted to share the recent experience of what it has been like selling <I>SW </I>in San Francisco. Several Saturdays ago, nine of us gathered for a noon sale in the Excelsior district of San Francisco--a multiracial, working-class neighborhood. </P>
<P>The front cover of the issue that called Bush a "Liar!" resonated very well with many of the people who passed by us. People we met on the sale expressed an extraordinary amount of anger at Bush, but were unsure about a real solution to the mess. By drawing out people more, we were able to talk about our alternative to the barbarism of capitalism. In the end, we were able to sell 28 copies of <I>SW</I>, and seven copies of our Spanish-language paper <I>Obrero Socialista</I>. </P>
<P>Many people are angry about the tax cuts and the occupation of Iraq, and are beginning to draw the right conclusions. But they are still not sure what they can do about it. </P>
<P>That is the crucial role that <I>SW</I> takes on. It shows people that we can actually make a difference, and that a different world is possible--and necessary.</P>
<P><B>Ed Hernandez, </B>San Francisco</P>

<p><a name="Paying"></a><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>Paying for Bush's campaigning</b></font></P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P><B>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</I></B></P>
<P>George W. Bush billed the U.S. when he was out campaigning during the 2002 elections. A report issued by the General Accounting Office (GAO) says that the Department of Health and Human Services picked up the tab at least 15 times when Bush went out of town. </P>
<P>Despite claims that this had nothing to do with Bush's campaigning appearances, the GAO still can't explain why Bush spent over $523,000 on these trips or why 14 of these 15 trips were during the election season last November. These trips coincided with campaign appearances for at least nine Republican gubernatorial candidates--including Scott McCallum in Wisconsin, Bob Taft in Ohio, Mark Sanford in South Carolina, and, of course, brother Jeb in Florida.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it's nothing new for presidents to abuse and misuse funds from an agency that should be spending money on sick and poor people. The GAO also discovered that Bill Clinton billed the Department of Health and Human Services on at least 37 occasions during his second term in office for various political events.</P>
<P>Once again, the White House has shown its complete hypocritical ability to make campaign promises--misusing money that could be spent on those promises. Isn't it great to be in a country where we pay to hear Bush lie to us?</P>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P><B>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</I></B></P>
<P>I am writing this to say that rank-and-file union members must put pressure on union officials to show that supporting the Democratic Party and just lobbying mainstream politicians is a dead end.</P>
<P>I am a steward in my union of public-sector workers. The last time we got a cost-of-living raise was when we participated with other unions in a one-day statewide strike on May 24, 2001.</P>
<P>We need to build solidarity throughout our public and private unions, and organize demonstrations, pickets and strikes. Only this way can we stop the attacks on living standards, working conditions and union rights, and build a society based on human need, not corporate greed.</P>
