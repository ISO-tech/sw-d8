<B><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><P>Dear <I>Socialist Worker,</P>
</B></I><P>I have seen the new face of terrorism--and I'm afraid I'm it. I am an employee of Verizon in New York City, and our current contract is expiring August 2. </P>
<P>In preparation for this, the company showed us a video to warn us about vandalizing or sabotaging phone cables. This by itself is no big deal, but in the video, a member of the Secret Service informed us that under the USA PATRIOT Act, sabotaging phone cables is now considered a terrorist act, and they will be involved with the investigation. </P>
<P>It's really scary and obscene to see what the laws of this country are really there for--the protection of capitalism by the continued oppression of the working class. </P>
<P>We were also shown propaganda on the harm that people being without phone service can cause--not being able to call 911 in an emergency, etc. But I guess that when your phone is out of service, and Verizon tells you they'll come to repair it in a month, that's okay. </P>
<P>I think that the true extent of the USA PATRIOT Act has yet to be seen, so beware: you might be the next terrorist.</P>
