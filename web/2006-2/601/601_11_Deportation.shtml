<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">NORTHAMPTON, Mass.--In a clear case of racial profiling, immigrant rights activist Olga Gonzales was stopped on September 5 for an expired inspection sticker on her car by an police officer on a bike.<p>
When asked for her driver's license, she gave her passport and her international driver's license, as she does not have a Massachusetts state license. Instead of being ticketed for the out-of-date inspection sticker, or having the car impounded for driving without a license, Olga was arrested and taken to the police station where the officer fingerprinted her to check for her immigration status.<p>
When it came back that she did not have legal status, he called the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Olga, a Springfield community organizer who has been involved in the struggle for immigrant rights, now faces deportation.<p>
Olga's arrest and possible deportation has been met by outrage from many in the local community, but it also adds to a climate of fear that surrounds everyday life for undocumented workers in the Pioneer Valley.<p>
Recently, two other immigrants disappeared while driving through Forest Park, and police seized 13 cars of farm workers in Springfield for having out-of-state plates. This campaign of intimidation and harassment by local police cannot continue.<p>
Local activists are pushing the Northampton city council to defend the human rights and civil liberties that are now under siege--to guarantee these civil liberties to all regardless of citizenship status, racial identification or country of origin. Activists are calling for Northampton to adopt a sanctuary city resolution that would forbid all city employees and law enforcement officers from enquiring into a person's immigration status and from enforcing federal immigration laws.<p>
These struggles for sanctuary city laws are extremely important right now, given that the Department of Homeland Security is currently testing a new program in Boston in which fingerprint checks by local or state police will be automatically cross-referenced in the ICE database to alert immigration officials of immigration violations.<p>
Ultimately, this could lead to a situation nationally where local police could submit these kinds of requests routinely during traffic stops or any other patrols simply to determine if someone was in the U.S. legally.<p>
<i>Contact Northampton Mayor Clare Higgins at 413-587-1249 or <a href="mailto:mayor@northamptonma.gov">mayor@northamptonma.gov</a> and Police Chief Russell Sienkiewicz at 413-587-1100 or <a href="mailto:police@northamptonma.gov">police@northamptonma.gov</a> to express your outrage over local police being used for immigration enforcement, and to support the adoption of a sanctuary city resolution</i>.<p>
