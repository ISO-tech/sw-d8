<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">NORTH KOREA'S test firing of missiles in early July was met by a barrage of hypocritical denunciations and racist invective from U.S. officials and the media.<p>
Media commentators and grandstanding Democrats were quick to point out the contrast between the Bush administration's relatively mild response to the test firing and its zero-tolerance rhetoric about Iraq before the 2003 invasion.<p>
Backtracking from his previous attitude of open hostility to North Korea, George Bush pledged to "make sure we work with our friends and allies." At a news conference, he referred continually to the importance of "diplomacy"--exactly what White House officials scornfully rejected in the case of Iraq.<p>
There <i>is </i>a double standard here--owing primarily to the immediate importance of Iraq to the Bush administration, both because of its oil reserves and its strategic location in a region the U.S. is intent on dominating without rivals.<p>
But the pundits and politicians who criticized Bush's "moderate" response on North Korea are wrong in their claim that the White House is ignoring a greater danger. According to the far-from-radical national security analyst Anthony Cordesman, "the main risk seems to be that North Korea is beginning early testing of a missile that could throw the equivalent of a rock at Alaska."<p>
As in previous attempts, the North Korean rocket test failed two minutes less than two minutes after launch.<p>
The country's economy is in a permanent state of crisis, crushed under the weight of U.S. sanctions and cut off from foreign loans and international aid. Thus, the government is economically incapable of creating a successful offensive weapons program--experts estimate that each test eats up as much as 10 percent of the country's scarce foreign exchange reserves at a pop. <p>
In reality, its weapons program is aimed at deterring an attack--most likely from the U.S. Anyone who thinks the North Korean military represents a threat to the U.S. is deluded. But to politicians from both parties, it remains a convenient bogeyman.<p>
The rhetoric about North Korean militarism only serves to highlight the gaping hypocrisy of the Washington establishment.<p>
Ironically, on the same day as the North Korean test, the U.S. launched its own giant rocket--carrying a manned spacecraft called the Discovery. But in spite of the Pentagon's sponsorship of the space shuttle program and the administration's open talk of putting weapons into space--last year, the U.S. became the first country ever to oppose an annual nonbinding United Nations in favor of preventing an arms race in outer space--there was no media uproar about this "threat to peace."<p>
Meanwhile, the Bush administration was pressuring Congress to approve a new initiative to share nuclear technology with the Indian government--which conducted its own rocket test in July, launching a new missile designed to carry nuclear warheads across much of Asia and the Middle East.<p>
Opponents of U.S. wars and occupations need to expose U.S. hypocrisy over North Korea and focus attention on the real madmen--the ones in the White House.<p>
