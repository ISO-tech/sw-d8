<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THERE'S a dime's worth of difference between many Democrats and Republicans in this election, but the distinction isn't worth even that much in one Nevada race.<p>
As the far-from-radical <i>Las Vegas Sun </i>put it, "Jill Derby doesn't want to cut and run in Iraq. She's against amnesty for illegal immigrants. She says her opponent is a 'big-taxing liberal.' And if elected to Congress, this daughter of a Nevada rancher would cut wasteful government spending and restore fiscal discipline.<p>
"Quick: Guess which political party she belongs to. You'd be hard pressed to tell from her tough talk and rural-themed campaign ads, but Derby is the Democrat in Nevada's 2nd Congressional District race."<p>
The 2nd district--which covers all of the state outside of Las Vegas and its suburbs--is normally a safe seat for Republicans, but this year, the incumbent is leaving office to run for governor, and Derby has a shot at riding the anti-GOP sentiment to victory.<p>
If she does pull off the upset, the Democrats shouldn't count on her sitting down on her side of the aisle next January. Derby doesn't identify herself as a Democrat in her campaign ads or even on her Web site. "I'm a Nevada Democrat, not a California Democrat," Derby told a reporter.<p>
But that hasn't stopped the party leadership from championing Derby and her campaign. "Jill Derby is the absolute perfect Democrat to run in this district," said Adrienne Elrod, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. And none other than John Kerry, the Democrats' allegedly too-liberal presidential candidate in 2004, personally sponsored a fundraising appeal for Derby that raked in $18,000 in contributions.<p>
Apparently, there is no candidate too much like the Republicans for the Democrats to celebrate, if they think it will help them win another seat in Congress.<p>
