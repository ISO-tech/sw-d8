<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">WHEN BRITISH police shot Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes 10 times on a London subway train, they claimed it was a tragic, but unavoidable, mistake.<p>
De Menezes looked like a suicide bomber, they claimed. He was wearing a bulky, padded coat that could have hidden explosives. He was acting suspicious. He refused to stop when ordered and jumped over turnstiles to get into a subway station. He tripped and fell after boarding a train, and only then did police pump seven bullets into his head.<p>
All lies.<p>
According to reports in the British media, the government inquiry into de Menezes' death concluded that he was wearing a light denim jacket when he left his home. His apartment was under surveillance, but de Menezes himself wasn't properly identified as a bystander when he left because the officer monitoring the entrance was "relieving himself" at the time.<p>
Assuming that de Menezes was a match for a terrorism suspect, British officers were instructed to not allow him to board a train. But instead of arresting the unarmed man during the more than 30 minutes that they followed him that morning, police waited for the arrival of a special armed police unit--trained in a shoot-to-kill technique perfected in Israel, that includes firing multiple rounds into a potential suspect's head.<p>
There was never a reason for police to believe that de Menezes was a suicide bomber. Rather than racing into the subway station and hopping a turnstile--as police initially claimed--closed-circuit footage shows de Menezes calmly walking into the station, using his transit card to enter and proceeding down an escalator to the train platform.<p>
As many as 20 officers eventually stormed into the rail station and began chasing de Menezes. Once on board a train, de Menezes had already been restrained by an officer when the rest of the armed police team arrived. He was pushed to the floor of a train and shot to death with automatic weapons.<p>
The scandal doesn't stop there. Another media report revealed that Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote to government officials shortly after the shooting, requesting that an investigation be delayed--in the name of protecting British "terrorist operations."<p>
British officials still refuse to retreat on the "shoot-to-kill" policy that led to de Menezes' death. "The methods that were used appeared to be the least worst option," Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair told the <i>Daily Mail</i>. Last week, he went further, announcing an expansion of his firearms unit to cope with the so-called "terrorist threat." <p>
Commissioner Blair told <i>Sunday's News of the World </i>that he doesn't want "anti-terror investigators [to be] affected" by the uproar in Britain over de Menezes' gruesome murder. "I have told them, 'This is not your problem,'" he said. "For myself, it's a job I have to do. And I am not going to be distracted from the main job, which is finding the terrorists."<p>
This is a slap in the face to Jean Charles de Menezes--and every other victim of Bush and Blair's "war on terror."<p>
