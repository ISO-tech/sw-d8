<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">GEORGE W. BUSH went on national television last week to claim that New Orleans' poor and Black residents will have a home to return to. But it's corporations and the rich--not ordinary people--who are poised to reap the benefits from the Bush administration plan to rebuild New Orleans.<p>
Rather than providing resources to those in need, the reconstruction of New Orleans looks set to remake the city according to the priorities of business interests--and minus a sizeable part of its poor and Black population.<p>
A large portion of the more than $60 billion immediately earmarked for post-Katrina "economic development" appears to be headed straight into the pockets of real estate developers and New Orleans' wealthy neighborhoods, where clean up and reconstruction is happening first.<p>
As many as half of the city's 160,000 homes in poorest areas are expected to be demolished, so a sizeable proportion of business leaders and politicians now see the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina as an opportunity for keeping the poor out.<p>
As Bruce Rutherford, head of the Houston-based Katrina response team for Jones Lang LaSalle--a major owner and manager of commercial real estate--speculated to <i>Business Week</i>, "Owners of first-rate buildings [in New Orleans] might actually come out ahead, because damaged, lower-quality office space may be torn down, creating a tighter market." <p>
Lawyer Ashton O'Dwyer explained to a reporter from the Toronto <i>Globe and Mail </i>why the catastrophe in New Orleans is an opportunity to settle old scores. "Whatever you do, don't put people back in the city who are criminals and who are incapable of, or unwilling to, help themselves," he told a reporter. "What was once unacceptable in polite, respectable society has not only become commonplace over the past 30 years of Negro rule in this city, but it has become acceptable," he added.<p>
As Harvard University economist Edward Glaeser bluntly told the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, arguing for a "scaled back"--and wealthier--New Orleans: "Given just how much, on a per capita basis, it would take to rebuild New Orleans to its former glory, lots of residents would be much [better off] with $10,000 and a bus ticket to Houston."<p>
Some politicians are already pressing for a new government agency to oversee reconstruction. Chief among those mentioned as candidates to head it up is former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, a man notorious for his "slash-and-burn" approach to workers' jobs and wages.<p>
Explaining his business-first approach to rebuilding New Orleans, Welch recently wrote in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> that "Hurricane Katrina has the potential to...compel leaders in government and business to find ways to break the city's cycle of poverty and corruption...Just watch the entrepreneurs rush in with ideas and energy, revitalizing old and creating new businesses, with the help of the money politicians will be outbidding one another to throw at the problem."<p>
How New Orleans' workers and poor would fare in this "rush" is left unsaid, but if the example of New York City after September 11 is anything to go buy, they will be left out in the cold--while businesses clean up.<p>
According to several watchdog groups that monitored the reconstruction of lower Manhattan following the World Trade Center attacks, federal aid was used mainly to fuel gentrification, while ignoring the needs of low-income people.<p>
"After 9/11, rules that normally restrict federal economic funding to primarily benefit low- and moderate-income communities were stripped out, so that money could legally go to large businesses and wealthy neighborhoods," Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York said in a statement. "As a result, these funds have yet to create any affordable housing or good new jobs for low-income residents of Lower Manhattan."<p>
