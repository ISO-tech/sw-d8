<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY and Marxist historian Pierre Brou&eacute; died on July 27 at the age of 79 after a long struggle with cancer.<p>
A large part of Brou&eacute;'s contribution to the revolutionary cause was his many books on the history of the Bolshevik Party, the Communist International, Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky and the Spanish and German revolutions.<p>
His history of the German Revolution of 1917-23 was recently published in English and is being distributed by Brill and Haymarket Books.<p>
Brou&eacute;'s life was one dedicated to the struggle for socialism. He fought in the French resistance against Nazi occupation as a young man. Brou&eacute; joined the Young Communists; and soon after was won over to Trotskyism, which he defended to the end.<p>
For many years, Brou&eacute; was a member of the l'Organisation Communiste Internationaliste. More recently, he was a supporter of the Committee for a Marxist International. Just before his death, he was taking part in the In Defense of Marxism's "Trotsky Project," a plan to republish the works of Trotsky.<p>
"With the passing of Pierre Brou&eacute; we have lost one of the great historians of the working-class movement," wrote Spanish socialist Jaime Pastor on the corriente[a]lterna Web site. "The best homage we can pay him is to remember his works and to continue recommending them to new generations."<p>
