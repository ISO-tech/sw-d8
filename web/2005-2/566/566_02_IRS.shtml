<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THE INTERNAL Revenue Service (IRS) has warned a California church that it could lose its tax-exempt status. Why? Because of an antiwar sermon that took place two days before last year's presidential election.<p>
At the sermon, Rev. George Regas of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena--one of the state's largest and most progressive churches--imagined Jesus participating in a political debate with then-candidates George W. Bush and John Kerry. Regas didn't tell parishioners who to vote for, but he did criticize the war--and imagined Jesus telling Bush, "Mr. President, your doctrine of pre-emptive war is a failed doctrine."<p>
Later in the sermon, Regas said he thought Jesus would chastise <i>both </i>Bush and Kerry for supporting the war. But that wasn't enough to protect the church from the IRS. In June, the agency sent a letter threatening to revoke the church's tax-exempt status for "intervening" in a political campaign or election.<p>
The church has vowed to fight. "In a government that leans so heavily on religious values, that they would pull a stunt like this, it makes me heartsick," Anne Thompson, who goes to All Saints, told the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.<p>
Several other churches critical of administration policies have faced similar IRS investigations during Bush's time in office. But there's no similar record of the Feds targeting right-wing churches. <p>
Like the 11,000-member evangelical New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colo., for example, where right-wingers are regularly invited to speak. Right-wing pundit Dinesh D'Souza--known for his bigoted views on race, gender and sexuality--recently visited New Life to discuss why the war in Iraq was a righteous cause. The church also regularly promotes books by right-wingers like Newt Gingrich.<p>
But the IRS doesn't seem to be interested in investigating churches that <i>support</i> the war.<p>
