<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">TOP CHINESE government officials are scrambling to control the damage as a 50-mile toxic chemical slick flows down the Songhua River in the country's northeast. But the damage they're most concerned about is to their image.<p>
First, there was the cover-up of risky industrial practices, after officials in Jilin denied any environmental threats from a November 13 explosion that killed five workers at a state-owned petrochemical plant. Ten days later, top officials in the ruling Communist Party were forced to reveal that the accident dumped 100 tons of cancer-causing benzene and nitrobenzene into the river.<p>
The news didn't emerge until officials in Harbin, a downstream city of 3.8 million, had to explain why they needed to shut off the city's water supply for five days as the chemical slick passed by.<p>
When the taps got reopened last weekend, Prime Minister Wen Jibao flew to Harbin for a series of photo ops, where he promised to punish company officials responsible for the accident and government officials responsible for the cover-up. Wen's visit recalled his 2003 public-relations trip to SARS-stricken Hong Kong after the regime suppressed news of a previous outbreak in neighboring Guangdong Province.<p>
But no sooner had water service been restored in Harbin when news emerged of a local coal-mine explosion that left at least 143 miners dead and 15 missing as <i>Socialist Worker </i>went to press.<p>
The roots of these disasters lie in China's breakneck economic growth--the result of the regime's wholehearted embrace of the free market.<p>
Workers have paid the price for this free-market madness. Rates of industrial accidents and environmental disasters are almost certainly the highest in the world--and are made worse by widespread official indifference to public health.<p>
In response, there has been a sharp rise in strikes and protests in the past two years. Officially recognized "mass incidents" grew from 58,000 in 2003 to 74,000 in 2004.<p>
Typically, top officials try to punish "corruption" at the lowest and most local level--to divert blame from themselves and the whole bureaucratic system. But even when they dodge the blame, their credibility falls. "We are in the midst of a growing gap between official and unofficial views Chinese hold," one analyst told the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>. "Every Chinese knows what they must think officially. But between that and what they do think is a wider gap."<p>
This gap is setting the stage for the struggles in China's future.<p>
